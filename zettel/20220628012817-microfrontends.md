# Microfrontends

> "An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole"

Essentially the frontend equivalent of microservices.

- smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
- more scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams
- the ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible
