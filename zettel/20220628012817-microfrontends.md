# Microfrontends

> "An architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole"

Essentially the frontend equivalent of microservices.

- smaller, more cohesive and maintainable codebases
- more scalable organisations with decoupled, autonomous teams, with clear ownership boundaries
- independently buildable and deployable
- the ability to upgrade, update, or even rewrite parts of the frontend in a more incremental fashion than was previously possible

There are some pitfalls, however:
- Giving teams too much freedom can lead to anarchy. Running different frontend technologies per MFE can lead to frontend performance issues
- Dependency versions get difficult and start to affect performance as users need to re-download them. [[20210927141042-module-federation]] provides a solution for this.
