# Digital Gardens

When researching how to publish my notes to a little corner of the web, the idea of a 'Digital Garden' came up.

I really like the name for it, and some of the tenets that they hold, namely:
- They are evergreen - constantly updated as knowledge grows
- Learning in the open
- Aims for progress over perfection
- A focus on bi-directional links

Going forward I'll probably slowly morph this from a bastardised Zettelkasten into a 'Digital Garden', or 'Second Brain'.
