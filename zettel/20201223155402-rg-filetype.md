# Search by filetype with ripgrep/emacs

As `emacs` (at least, Doom) uses `ripgrep` under the hood, it's possible to use `ripgrep` config/args to specify file filtering.

To search by **glob** use `-g`: `rg foo -g '*.tsx'`
To search by **file type** use `-t`: `rg foo -t ts`

To get a list of filetypes, you can use `rg --file-type`.

To pass the arguments in emacs, use a double dash `--` to separate the command: `foo -- -t ts`. In emacs, using quotes for `-g` seems to not work
