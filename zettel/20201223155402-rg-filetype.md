# Search by filetype with ripgrep/emacs

As `emacs` (at least, Doom) uses `ripgrep` under the hood, it's possible to use `ripgrep` config/args to specify a file type. In this case:

```
<search> -- -t <filetype>
```
e.g. `foo -- -t .tsx`

I've also had success with using a space inbetween different search terms, so that they don't have to be sequential. This also works for file types. e.g. `foo .tsx`

#emacs
#shell
