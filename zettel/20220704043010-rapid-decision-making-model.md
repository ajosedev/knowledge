# RAPID

RAPID is a model used to clarify decision accountability to help organisations make better decisions.

>In many companies, even clear, well framed decisions can be derailed by uncertainty over roles and responsibilities.

There are five different stakeholder roles:
1.  **Recommend**: create the initial proposals and recommendations
2.  **Agree**: Must agree the proposals from the Recommend group
3.  **Perform**: Execute the work following the decision
4.  **Input**: Provides information and facts to the Recommend group
5.  **Decide**: The person who has the authority to make the decision

Note that applying the RAPID model adds overhead which is not always necessary for every decision. However in theory it should increase buy-in from the organisation and achieve a better decision overall.
