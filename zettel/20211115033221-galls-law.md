# Gall's law

> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system

Begin with simple systems and then grow them in complexity. Develop iteratively in small steps rather than jumping to the end.
