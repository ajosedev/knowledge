# Reusable components and width

Similar to [[20200402104023-components-margin]], component benefit from being unopinionated about their width. That is, take up all the horizontal space given.

This keeps things simple, expected, and aligned with the base functionality of a `div` or other block-level elements.

Then if you require the component to be restricted, use a [[20200314214239-layout-components]] to handle that behaviour.
