# NODE_ENV in 12 factor

`NODE_ENV` is an interesting case when it comes to [[12factor]] rules.

It's tempting to both use it as a variable that controls many functions, or to use it to pick a collection of environment variables to use. I'd lean towards doing neither, and think of `NODE_ENV` as a standard environment variable used by both [[node]] itself, and usually [[dependencies]].

Keep environment variables [[20200307104931-orthogonality|orthogonal]], especially `NODE_ENV`. Don't use it to set certain Webpack settings, or only do things in prod, etc. Rely it on as little as possible, so you can tweak config at a finer grain.

Don't use it as a master switch to load a collection of environment variables either. Coupling `NODE_ENV` to loading environment variables means you can't easily separate the node environment from other variables, e.g. an integration environment with `NODE_ENV=production`
