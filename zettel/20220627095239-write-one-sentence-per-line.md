# Write one sentence per line

When drafting a document, try writing one sentence per line. The main benefits are:
- Helps you judge each sentence on its own. Some sentences are not worthy of their own line
- Helps vary the lengths of sentences to not sound robotic.
- Helps you rearrange sentences if needed.
- Helps you see first and last words. First words punch, last words linger. Chop weak beginnings like 'I think'

Before you publish it, make sure you have some way of combining separate lines into one paragraph, like Markdown or HTML.
