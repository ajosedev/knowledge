# CSS System Colours

CSS is starting to define system colours - colours that reflect default color choices made by the user, browser, or OS. For example, these colours change their underlying hex value if the user is using an OS dark mode.

Some examples include `Canvas`, `CanvasText`, `Field`, `Highlight`, and more.

Support as of right now is a little spotty, so these aren't really ready for prime time.
