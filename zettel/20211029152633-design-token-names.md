# Design token naming

The naming scheme for your design tokens is important, this is what people will be using to communicate, guide, and write in both design tools and code. Try to keep it concise while still conveying meaning.

Also known as a 'token hierarchy'

Some examples:
Asana uses `sentiment-usage-prominence-interaction`, e.g. `warning-text-default-hover`
Salesforce uses `component-category-property-attribute-relationship-state`
