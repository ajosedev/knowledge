# Switch in Go
`switch` without a condition can be used to write an `if/else` chain.

Case statements can have multiple expressions separated by a comma.
```go
switch motion {
    case "walk", "run":
        // Do something
```

Cases inside the switch also don't require a `break`, as it only runs the selected `case`.
To fall through programtically, the `fallthrough` keyword can be used.

There's also a type switch (TODO)
