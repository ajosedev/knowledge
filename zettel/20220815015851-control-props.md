# Control props

A fancy term for a pretty simple concept. Essentially the same pattern as [Controlled Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) in React forms.

Props that control the internal state of the component, where the state is managed at a higher place. e.g. passing a `value` and `onChange` to a `Checkbox` keeps the state at the component rendering the checkbox.
