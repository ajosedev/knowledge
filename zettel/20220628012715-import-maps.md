# Import maps

**Import maps** exist in a similar space to [[20210927141042-module-federation|module federation]], but supported by browsers natively. They allow control over what URLs get fetched by JS' `import` statements at _runtime_, by offering a separate mapping between the module and it's URL, rather than having to embed the has/location in every file. This allows you to update the imported module (and the import map) without updating the consuming module.
