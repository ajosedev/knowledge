# Composing microfrontends

There are three ways to compose a micro-frontendsÂ architecture. The decision should be based on your project.
- Client-side composition. An app shell loads microfrontends (usually from a CDN) often through a JS entrypoint. Works for both horizontal and vertical splits.
- Edge-side composition. Assembles the view at a CDN level. Usually uses Edge Side Includes (ESI). Only really makes sense for horizontal splits.
- Server-side composition. Cached at the CDN level and served at either compile or runtime. TTL would depend on how personalised the content is. Works for both horizontal and vertical splitting.
