# Design system boundaries

If you don't have accountability to components in your design system, these components fail to be prioritised, and become a bottleneck to teams that rely on them. Consider taking them out of your design system if possible to clear the path for all.

A clear boundary of what does and does not belong in the system creates a better sense of clarity, ownership, and thus accountability. This in turn, fosters a better relationship between teams.

It's easy to add, but much harder to remove or deprecate. Stand your ground.
