# Vim-surround cheat sheet

`evil-surround` uses `vim-surround` under the hood. A quick cheat sheet:

In visual mode:

To change surrounding elements `cs<old><new>`

```
'Hello world'
> cs'"
"Hello world"
```

To delete surrounding elements `cs<old>`

```
'Hello world'
> ds'
Hello world
```

To add surrounding elements `ys<selector><new>` - where selector is any vim text selector (e.g. `i)`, `iw`, `f)`, `ww`)

```
Hello world
> ysw" (key at start of first word)
"Hello world"
```
