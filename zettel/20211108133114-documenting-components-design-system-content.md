# Documenting components in a Design System - Content

## Intros
Naming components is hard, and navigation usually relies on this name
Considering adding in a 'also known as' to help demystify synonyms
Intros need to cover: my name is x, and what I do is y. Keep it short, tweet-length. Too long and your delaying from other important content, like examples. Keep extra detail for later.
> Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that house your content.

## Examples
The most important part of effective documentation
Show, don't tell. Pair code with examples when possible
Consider depicting the component's anatomy too
Don't go wild with combinations, keep those to testing environments. You don't have to show every single possibility
Show states without requiring interaction
If themes exist, demonstrate it

## Design reference
To produce quality guidelines, you'll need content architecture, writing conventions, good visuals, etc.
Consider categories such as: use when, visual style, behaviour, editorial, accessibility, dos/donts
Pictures are good, but words are easier to compose and update. Consider the tradeoff
