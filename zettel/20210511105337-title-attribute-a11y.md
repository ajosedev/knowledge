# Using `title` for a11y

From my understanding, using just `title` to provide information for screen readers isn't consistent enough to be a recommended solution. Seemingly some screen readers do not read the `title` when it is attached to some elements, although it will still display a tooltip for sighted users which can be helpful.

Perhaps a better solution is to use `aria-label` (or other methods, such as SR-only text, `aria-labelled-by`, etc.) when trying to communicate to sighted readers, or using both `aria-label` and `title` when trying to add more information.

If the tooltip itself is meant to be accessible, there's entirely different patterns that help solve that. Look into `aria-described-by` and `aria-labelled-by`. Tooltips in general have problems with accessibility, considering touch screens, input methods, etc.

`title` _does_ work better on `<input>` elements, but even then it's not ideal.
