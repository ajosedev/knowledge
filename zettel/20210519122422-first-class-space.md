# Space as a first-class concept

'First-class space' refers to the idea that space should be thought of on the same level as components, rather than as a by-product of components.

Space is something that goes _between_ components, they don't naturally have a certain amount of space they occupy. Since components can be used on any given page in any given way, space therefore becomes context specific and something that should be handled at a higher level (e.g. page-level).

This mindset is a lot closer to the `gap` property of CSS, and avoids having to deal with `:last-child` rules and similar.
