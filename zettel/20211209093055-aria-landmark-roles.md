[[20211206102038-aria-landmark-regions]]

Semantic HTML elements should be preferred when creating regions, see [[20211209092931-aria-landmark-regions-html]]

**Banner**
Site oriented content at the beginning of each page. Typically includes a site logo, and global nav.

**Complementary**
A supporting section of the document, designed to be complementary to the main content at a similar level in the DOM heirarchy, but still meaningful when separated.

**Contentintfo**
Common information at the bottom of each page, a 'footer'. Typically includes links to privacy/legals, copyright, etc.

**Form**
A region that contains a collection of objects and items that combine to create a form. Use this only if `search` or `main` is not applicable.

**Main**
Primary content of the page.

**Navigation**
Groups of links that are intended to be use for website or page content navigation.

**Region**
Section of the page containing content that is sufficiently important for users to be able to navigate to the section. Useful for identifying content that named landmarks do not appropriately describe.

**Search**
A collection of objects and items that combine to create search functionality.
