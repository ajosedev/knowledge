# Naming colour tokens in a design system

Broadly there's three naming conventions:
- Definitive - describe the colour itself
- Semantic - describe the intent of the colour
- Contextual - describe the use of the colour

Rather than considering these as separate paths, consider these as layers of abstractions. Ideally engineers are using contextual colours, while designers are using at least semantic colours in their day-to-day.

Consider [[20211029153348-semantic-design-tokens]] and [[20220523102023-design-tokens-as-intents]] when thinking about the maintenance of these colours.
