# :has selector

`:has` is the closest thing CSS has to a parent selector. It allows you to style 'up', rather than 'down', as the styles written don't apply to the selector but rather the parent element. The selector inside of the `:has()` almost acts entirely as a conditional, with the prefixed selector receiving the styles, which is unlike how CSS usually works.

`<selector to get styled>:has(<condition to match>)`

The following snippet applies styling to the `div` only if it contains a `p` inside of it.
```css
div:has(p) {
  background: red;
}
```

The following snippet applies styling to the `a` only if it has a direct descendent `img`
```css
a:has(> img) {
  border: 20px solid white;
}
```

As of now, this is not supported in any browser, although it's part of the same spec as `:is` and `:not`.

For some inspiration, this can be helpful for forms for selecting a `label` that is either a sibling of an `input`, or a parent of an `input`
