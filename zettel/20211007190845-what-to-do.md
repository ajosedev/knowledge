# Being told what to do as a senior

As you grow as an engineer, you improve at breaking down and achieving problems on a broader scale.

Aim to go from:
'What should I do next?'
to
'What are we trying to achieve?', and then you can figure out how to get there.

Instead of requiring someone to break down tasks, prioritise issues, follow up on problems, you can do that yourself. You become the pointman on the project - you make sure the project gets done.  Provide updates about how the project is tracking.

This doesn't mean you have to do all the work yourself. If you don't know something you ask questions. If you need help, you ask team members. You're just the _leader_.

One measure of success for a senior: carry a project from start to finish without your manager's input.
