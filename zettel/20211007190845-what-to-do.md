# Being told what to do as a senior

As you grow as an engineer, you improve at breaking down and achieving problems on a broader scale.

Aim to go from:
'What should I do next?'
to
'What are we trying to achieve?', and then you can figure out how to get there.

One measure of success for a senior: can you carry a project from start to finish without your manager's input?
