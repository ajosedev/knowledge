# Use post it notes when pair programming

When pair programming, it's important to avoid getting sidetracked. You're using the time of two people, so try to use it efficiently. One method to avoid getting sidetracked is to use post-it notes. If an issue arises, or something you want to look into comes up, write it down and circle back later.

Solo programming allows yu to go down rabbit holes on your own time, so wait until then for any deep dives.
