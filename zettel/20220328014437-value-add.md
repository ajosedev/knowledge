# What is a value add?

>The term value add describes anything that makes a given product, service, feature, or other topic of discussion objectively or subjectively better than a 'baseline value'. Anything that enhances the value of an existing value proposition.

The 'baseline value' here is often the baseline of what the consumer is already using, or what your competitors offer. 'Add' is relative, so what makes it _better_ than something else?
