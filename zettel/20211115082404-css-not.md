# :not selector

> The `:not()` CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.

`<selector to match>:not(<selector to avoid matching>)`

Interestingly, this allows you to create a [[donut scope]]. Donut scope is a scope that allows for a hole in the middle. Helpful when wanting to style the component wrapper, inner elements owned by the component, but not anything in 'slots' where other components can be nested.

`article p:not(blockquote *)` would match all `p` elements inside of an `article`, but not descendents of a `blockquote`.
