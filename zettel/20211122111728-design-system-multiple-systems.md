# Design systems are systems of systems

A good answer for: 'what is a design system?: a system of systems.

A design system often contains many subsystems that build together to make a complete design system:
- UI components and variants in design and code
- Design tokens
- Typography system
- Colour system
- Layout system
- Icon system

However, they shouldn't contain _every_ system. [[20211122112210-design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces]]
