# Pareto principle

> For many outcomes, roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of causes

Often known as the 80/20 rule.

This applies to many categories, from computing to sports.

Some examples are:
- 20% of the code has 80% of the bugs
- Fixing 20% of the most reported bugs fixes 80% of all errors
- 80% of execution time is over 20% of the code
