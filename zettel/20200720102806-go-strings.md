# Strings in Go

Strings are zero-indexed

Strings in go are **immutable**, this means another variable that references a string will not change if the original string does.
There is a mutable version of strings that can be used, which is a slice of bytes `[]byte`.

String literals are encapsulated in **double quotes**, raw string literals can be created using **backticks**, which preserve all whitespace, etc.
