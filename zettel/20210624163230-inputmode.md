# Inputmode (vs input type)

`inputmode` is a global attribute (i.e. works on more than just `input` elements) that acts as a **hint** for browsers to display a specific on-screen keyboard depending on the value given. This is very useful for only showing relevant input based on the input, e.g. a on-screen numpad for a telephone input.

This attribute differs from `type`, which also changes the way the browser interprets the input. `type` may offer a completely different input (e.g. a slider for `type=range`), as well as in-built validation, among other things.

It's usually better to use `type` as it affords more accessibility and features, such as _requiring_ a specific input
