# Tech debt, and when to fix it

A feature freeze that lets you tackle your mountain of tech debt at once will never happen. Don't count on it.

Instead, **chip away at tech debt constantly**.
When you're working on a feature in the area, make that component better.
When you're using a dependency, update it.
See some unclear logic? Rewrite it.

This concept is also referred to as 'gardening', the 'scout rule', or the 'campsite rule' - leave things better than you found them.
