A **region** is a physical location that consists of two or more Availability Zones

An **availability zone (AZ)** is one or more data centres in a certain proximity to one another

**Edge locations** are endpoints for AWS that are used for caching, usually with CloudFront.

There are more edge location than AZs, and more AZs than regions.
