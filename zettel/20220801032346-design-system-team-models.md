# Design system team models

1. **Solitary** (“The Overlord”). “_A solitary model sees a one team make a system available, but with efforts focused primarily on that team’s needs._”
2. **Centralized**. “_A single, central design team produces and supports a system used by others as a part of their job._”
3. **Federated**. “_Designers from multiple product teams decide on the system together._”
4. **Cyclical.** A combination of the 2 & 3, where the centrailised 'core team' act as a librarian and facilitate with users outside of the team that keep the DS accurate, current, and useful.
