# Interfaces in Go

Go interfaces are unlike most other languages, and are more akin to a typesafe duck-typing. An interface contains only a list of one or more function signatures but does not implement any of them. This happens **implicitly**. That is, the type does not have to declare that it implements this or another interface.

Interfaces in Go don't have names that describe **attributes** (e.g. `Boxable`), they have names that describe **behaviour** (e.g. `Reader`)

```go
type Helloer interface {
    Hello(string)
}
```

Creating a type (and method) that matches this interface will automatically implement it, for example:
```go
type Greeting string
func (g Greeting) Hello(name string) {
    fmt.Println(g+",", name)
}
```

When a function accepts an interface type as a parameter, we can pass any type to the function that satisfies the interface. The function then can use the passed-in argument in a uniform way without having to care about the concrete type behind the interface.

Interfaces are implemented as two elements, a type (`T`) and a value (`V`).

An interface value that holds a nil concrete value is itself non-nil (as it will have a type). If the concrete value inside the interface itself is nil, the method will be called with a nil receiver. If neither exist, the interface is nil - calling a method on this is a run-time error.
