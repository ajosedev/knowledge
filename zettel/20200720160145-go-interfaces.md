# Interfaces in Go

Go interfaces are unlike most other languages, and are more akin to a typesafe duck-typing. An interface contains only a list of one or more function signatures but does not implement any of them. This happens _implicitly_. That is, the type does not have to declare that it implements this or another interface.

```go
type Helloer interface {
    Hello(string)
}
```

Usually, the name of the interface describes its purpose, e.g. 'Reader'. Creating a type (and method) that matches this interface will automatically implement it, for example:
```go
type Greeting string
func (g Greeting) Hello(name string) {
    fmt.Println(g+",", name)
}
```

When a function accepts an interface type as a parameter, we can pass any type to the function that satisfies the interface. The function then can use the passed-in argument in a uniform way without having to care about the concrete type behind the interface.
