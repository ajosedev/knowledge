# Lifecycle management in S3

Lifecycle management automates moving objects between different storage tiers for cost effectiveness.
e.g. after not being accessed in Standard in 30 days, move to Standard-IA.

It can also be combined with versioning to help manage those versions. e.g. only transition previous versions of objects.
