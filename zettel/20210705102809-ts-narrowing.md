# Narrowing in Typescirpt

By default, Typescript is very capable of **narrowing** types based on control flow. This is done through standard looking Javascript code, rather than having to explicitly hint at the types. The control flow analysis is quite complex and capable of splitting and re-merging repeatedly, as types can often change at different points.

It can do this through various means, such as:
`typeof` guards:
```typescript
if (typeof padding === "number") {
    return padding + 1;
    // padding: number
}
```

Truthiness narrowing:
```typescript
if (padding) {
    return padding + 1;
    // padding: truthy (no longer null or undefined)
}
```

Equality narrowing:
```typescript
function example(x: string | number, y: string | boolean) {
  if (x === y) {
    // We can now call any 'string' method on 'x' or 'y'.
  }
}
```

`in` operator narrowing:
```typescript
type Fish = { swim: () => void };
type Bird = { fly: () => void };

function move(animal: Fish | Bird) {
  if ("swim" in animal) {
    return animal.swim();
  }

  return animal.fly();
}
```
