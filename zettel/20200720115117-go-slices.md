# Slices in Go

Slices in Go are similar to arrays. [[20200720115114-go-arrays]]

Given an array a:
```go
a := [8]int{}
```
The slice operation creates a slice from array a, from element 3 up to, but not including, element 7. 
```go
s := a[3:7]
```

This slice acts as a reference to the underlying array, so modifying a slice will affect the underlying array (and also any other slices of said array).

`append` lets you append new elements to a slice (returns a new slice), while simultaneously increasing the capacity of the slice if necessary. This expansion may be done by creating a new underlying array.

Slices can be created from scratch without an array - an underlying array is still being created but will remain anonymous:
```go
var s []int   // s == nil
s = []int{}  // s == []
```

_length_ of a slice refers to the amount of elements inside the slice `len()`
_capacity_ of a slice refers to the amout of elements in the underlying array `cap()`
