# Variadic args in Go

Variadic functions can be called with any number of trailing arguments. The arguments can then be accessed as an array inside the function.
```go
func sum(nums ...int)

sum(1, 2)
sum(1, 2, 3)

slice := []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
sum(slice)
```

Cannot mix a slice and individual args to a variadic function, e.g. `sum(1, 2, slice)`
