# Flow containers
Don't set margins on individual typography elements for vertical rhythm. You will constantly be overwriting and removing them in different use cases.

Instead, handle the spacing using a container component, which allows you to customise the spacing and only applies when you want it to.

```css
  .flow > * + * {
    --flow-space: 1em;
    margin-top: var(--flow-space);
  }
```
