# Different font units in CSS

Both `ch` and `ex` pertain to the (approximate) width and height of one character respectively.

`ch` is equal to the **width** of a `0`
`ex` is equal to the **height** of a `x`

`ch` is helpful for restricting max-widths for readability. [[20210201144247-line-length]]
