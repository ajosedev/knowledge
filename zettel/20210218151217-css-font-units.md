# CSS units

### Font-size related units

`em` - font size of the parent element
`rem` font size of the root element

`em` is a good candidate for adding padding to typographic elements. That way, when the font-size of the text grows, the padding/spacing between components grows also.

### Character units

Both `ch` and `ex` pertain to the (approximate) width and height of one character respectively.

`ch` is equal to the **width** of a `0`
`ex` is equal to the **height** of a `x`

`ch` is helpful for restricting max-widths for readability. [[20210201144247-line-length]]

### Viewport units

`vw` - 1% of the viewports width
`vh` - 1% of the viewports height
`vmin` - 1% of the viewports smaller dimension (in portrait, this would be width)
`vmax` - 1% of the viewports larger dimension (in portrait, this would be height)
