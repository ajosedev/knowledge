# Fail fast

> Fail fast, follow the fun

Games that 'design themselves', by building a working prototype, realising what works and what doesn't and then following the most fun. Can help take a vague idea into a working game (or product, etc), that is wildly different from the original idea you had in your head, but much more fun

The working prototype is crucial, as without it you're still thinking of ideas, what you _think_ is fun, not what you _know_ is fun.
