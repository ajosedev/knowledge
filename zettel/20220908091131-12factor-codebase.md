# 12 Factor: 1. Codebase
**One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys**

One app = One codebase = one repo
Multiple codebases = distributed system = multiple apps that can individually be 12 factored.

Only one app, but many deploys of the app. A deploy is a running instance of the app, e.g. production, staging, local, etc.
