# Centralising patterns in a design system

When it comes to design systems, we think that once we've made a centralised pattern, no-one needs to make that UI effort again, it is 'solved'.

Much like non-UI code, abstracting too early can create a subpar solution that doesn't capture all the problems. Be comfortable with duplicating effort to better understand the problem and context.

>We have to diverge before we can converge, or we risk creating a solution thatâ€™s too constraining to be useful.
