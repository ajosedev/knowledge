# Loops in Go
Go only has one type of loop, the `for` loop. It contains a _initialisation expression_, a _condition_, and a _post operation_

It reads like most other for loops, but the _init_ and _post_ statements are optional. 
This lets it function as a `while` loop.

Regular: `for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {`
While: `for i < 10 {`

The `range` keyword can be used to loop over an array or similar lists. The element returned is a **copy**.
```go
for index, element := range s
```
