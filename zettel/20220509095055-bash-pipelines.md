# Pipes in Bash

Using the `|` pipe operator allows you to send the output of one command as input to another command.

Multiple commands can be chained to create a pipeline.

```
command 1 | command2 | command3
```

To run a series of commands in sequential order without passing output/input, use the following operators:

`&&` - run command if the last one did not fail (zero exit status code)
`||` - run command if the last one failed (non-zero exit status code)
`;` - run command regardless of the last exit code
