# Focus outlines

`box-shadow` doesn't render in high-contrast modes.
The default focus styles also are inaccessible, depending on the background colour of the page.
A good fix is to use a transparent outline, which will only show in those high-contrast modes:
  
```css
:focus {  
  outline: 2px solid transparent;  
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, .8);  
}  
```
