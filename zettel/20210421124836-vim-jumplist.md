# Jumplist commands in Vim

### Jumps (:jumplist)
`CTRL+O` - cycle backwards through cursor positions
`CTRL+I` - cycle forwards through cursor positions

`''` - jump to position of last jump (start of line)
` `` ` - jump to position of last jump (same location on line)
\`\. - jump to position of last change

Note that `hjkl` don't update the jumplist, so commands like `''` will not work for `2j`

### Changes (:changes)
`g;` - jump to position of the previous change
`g,` - jump to position of the next change
