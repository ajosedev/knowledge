# EC2 AMIs

An AMI (amazon managed instance) is an image of the entire virtual machine, including one or more EBS snapshots, launch permissions, and a mapping that specifies volumes to attach. When launching an EC2 instance, you must select an AMI to choose its configuration.

It is possible to create your own AMI using an existing AMI as a base.
