# Ok in Go

Calling functions returns an `ok` variable, which can be used to check if the operation completed successfully.

This is known as the 'comma ok' idiom.

```go
str, ok := value.(string)
if ok {
    fmt.Printf("string value is: %q\n", str)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("value is not a string\n")
}
```

Or a shorter version:
```go
if seconds, ok := timeZone[tz]; ok {
	return seconds
}
```
