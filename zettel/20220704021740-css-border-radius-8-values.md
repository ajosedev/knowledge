# Border-radius accepts 8 values

Often `border-radius` uses 1-4 values, each corresponding to a corner of the 'box'. However eight values can actually be passed, corresponding to the horizontal and vertical radius of each corner.

Values before the slash are responsible for horizontal distances, values after the slash are responsible for vertical distances.

This can help you create organic shapes with just CSS.
