# Types in Go

Types can be helpful when two different things shared the same format (e.g. primitive type), but have a different meaning.
The keyword `type` is followed by the name of the new type, followed by the _underlying type_ that the new type is made of.
```go
type km float64
```

It's possible to convert between types, if the types share the same underlying type.
