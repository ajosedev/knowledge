# AWS Direct Connect

AWS Direct Connect is a cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your premises to AWS.

In many cases, you can reduce your network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and improve the network experience compared to internet-based connections.

Two different types of Direct Connect Connection
Dedicated Connection - A physical ethernet connection associated with a single customer
Hosted Connection - A physical ethernet connection through a AWS Direct Connect Partner, such as an ISP.

VPNs allow private communication but it still traverses the public internet. While secure, it can be painfully slow.
