# Private and Public functions in Go

Go distinguishes between external and internal functions through spelling alone.

All **public** functions, types and variables must start with an **uppercase** letter.
All **private** functions, types and variables must start with a **lowercase** letter.

That is why `fmt.Println` has a capital 'P'.

This counts for things like library functions, structs, etc.
