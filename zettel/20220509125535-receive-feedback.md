# How to receive feedback

_"Hey your sweater is nice! You have great taste"_

_"Oh this old thing? Pfft"_

You just told someone never to give you a compliment. They were looking for a feel good moment and you made it awkward.

Say Thank You then shut up. Simple. But hard.

Same with negative feedback. Say thank you, ask for examples, dig in with clarifying questions, and _do not defend yourself_. Accept.
Here's the thing about feedback. Positive feedback feels good and negative feedback helps you improve. Which do you want?
