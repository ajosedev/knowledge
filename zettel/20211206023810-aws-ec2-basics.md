# AWS EC2 Basics

Elastic Compute Cloud.

Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A VM, but hosted by AWS.
Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Managed by you, you have complete control - grow and shrink as needed.

A game changer when first released, as you no longer had to manage on-prem hardware that needed to plan for future scaling. Pay only what you use.
