# The root account in AWS

The **root account** is the email address that signed up for AWS. It has full admin access, so it needs to be secured. Ideally the root account is never used, so secure the root account by:
- Enable MFA
- Create an admin group for admins, with appropriate permissions
- Create user accounts for your admins
- Add your users to the admin group
- Use these user accounts over the root account
