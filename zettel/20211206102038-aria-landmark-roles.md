# Landmark roles

Regions of the page intended as navigational landmarks. Useful for screen readers to provide keyboard navigation to important sections of a page.

Too many landmark roles create 'noise', so use sparingly.

Screen readers announce the type of role for landmark roles. For this reason, don't describe what the landmark is in its label - 'Primary navigation' -> 'Primary navigation navigation'.

If a landmark is only used once, it may not require a label. If there are multiple instnaces of the same type of landmark, add a unique label *unless* the content and purpose of separate instances are identical (e.g. two pagination controls above and below a list).
