Amazon's own [[NoSQL]] database.

Fully managed, and supports both document and key/value data models.

Stored on SSD storage, spread across 3 geoegraphically distinct data centers.

By default, it has eventually consistent reads [[20220131033026-aws-dynamodb-reads]]

DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
	Fully managed highly availble in-memory cache
	10x performance improvement
	Reduces request time from millisecond to microseconds
	Can act as a middleware cache, so you don't have to manage hitting a cache vs dynamoDB.
	
On-demand capacity
	Pay-per-request pricing
	Balance cost and performance
	Pay more per request than with provisioned capacity
	
Security
	Encryption at rest using KMS

Two different types of backups
- On-demand backup and restore
	Full backups at any time, with zero impact on performance/availability
- Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)
	Protects against accidental writes or deletes
	Incremental backups
	Not enabled by default
