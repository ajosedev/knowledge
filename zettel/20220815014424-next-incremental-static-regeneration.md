# Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) in Next

>On-Demand Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) allows you to update the content on your site without needing to redeploy. This makes it easy to update your site immediately when data changes in your headless CMS or commerce platform

This also means you don't have to rebuild the entire site.

This isn't a polling feature either, instead you can trigger a page to rebuild(?) through a webhook using something like a Github Action.
