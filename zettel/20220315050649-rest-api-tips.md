# Tips for better REST API design

Be consistent. This applies across all other tips. It's the most important thing to get right. If a consumer understands one endpoint, they then understand all of them.
Some areas for consistency:
- Casing
- Pluralisation
- Error messages
- Error codes
- HTTP methods
- Authentication

Make public endpoints the exception. Every endpoint should require authorisation by default.

Provide a health check endpoint, e.g. `GET /health`

Version the API. It's best to set this up for the first version. Can be done through various means, such as HTTP headers, path parameters, or query parameters.
