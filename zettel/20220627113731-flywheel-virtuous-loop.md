# The flywheel effect

aka 'virtuous loop' or 'virtuous cycle'

Small wins accumulate over time, creating momentum that keeps your business growing. A system where one desirable event leads to another in a continuous cycle of reinforcement.

Creating a flywheel effect requires removing friction and applying force. Make things easier for the wheel to keep turning.

Based on Jim Collins' *Good to Great*.
