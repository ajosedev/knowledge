Here’s how the Design System Flywheel works:
1. Community is critical because it leads to contribution. We can involve users in different steps in the Design System to create shared ownership. We create trust with transparent communication and consistency. Trust and shared ownership sit at the core of a community.
2. When there is more contribution, it increases the scalability of the design system. We no longer only rely on the Design System team to create components. It also gives us more opportunities to collaborate with our users. When we collaborate, we enable the Design System to have more _meaningful_ coverage — just more coverage is not always better.
3. More collaboration will cultivate the feeling of ownership and establish trust, which helps build the community.
4. As the Design System grows, it will have better visibility and increase social pressure for adoption. We can celebrate the adopters’ achievements to boost social pressure. We also need to make sure that we have a good customer support system to maintain trust.
5. As adoption goes up, it increases the opportunities for more humans to join the community.
