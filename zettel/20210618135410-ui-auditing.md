# Tips for auditing UI

It's useful to do a UI audit when trying to get a lay of the land. For example, when creating a new form component, it's useful to see what's currently in use and find the answers to the following questions:

- What variants do we have currently?
- What are the current use cases?
- Are there any bespoke implementations?
- How will this be used in the future?

Some tips:

- Screenshots are really really really helpful, and they're probably the best tool for documenting.

  - Big screenshots are useful for providing context
  - Focused screenshots are useful to highlight differences
  - Screenshots eliminate the need to document some things (e.g. where this variant is located)

- Use a tool like Figma, rather than a doc

  - This helps prioritise the information, leave annotations, etc.
  - Helps to see things side by side, rather than a scrolling page

- Create a board that documents the different variants and how they differ

  - e.g. if the typeface/size is different, document it!
  - This is the bread and butter of the document, the rest is useful for providing context

- Disable extensions/non-default colours
