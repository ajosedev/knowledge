# Cookies

A primer on cookies.

An HTTP cookie is key/value pair used to store data in the browser. Since HTTP is stateless, cookies can send cookies to the server to create 'state'.

A cookie has three main things:
- key
- value
- expiry
A cookie can only be used on one domain (and its subdomains).

Cookies are mainly used for three main purposes:
- Session management
- Personalisation
- Tracking

Servers can set a cookie on a browser using the `Set-Cookie` HTTP header. Browser can send that back through a `Cookie` HTTP header. Remember that servers don't store cookies. They use sessions.

Remember that users can easily edit/supply their own cookies, so consider the security implications.
