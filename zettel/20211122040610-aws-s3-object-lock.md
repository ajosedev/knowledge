# S3 Object Lock

You can use S3 Object Lock to store object using a 'write once, read many' (WORM) model. It can help prevent objects from being deleted or modified for a fixed/indefinite amount of time (its retention period). Useful for regulatory requirements.

In **governance mode**, users can't overwrite or delete an object version or alter its lock settings unless they have special permissions.

In **compliance mode**, a protected object can't be overwritten or deleted by any user, including the root user.

A *legal hold* prevents an object version from being overwritten or deleted, similar to a retention period. However it's indefinite until it is removed.

Glacier Vault Lock allows you to easily deploy and enforce complicance controls in Glacier, such as the WORM model.
