# Interface Segregation Principle

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

Don't making interfaces that cater to every and all need. Instead, compose smaller, focused interfaces together to fill the need on a case-by-case basis..
