# No feigning surprise

Don't act surprised when people say they don't know something. Both technical and non-technical.

It adds no benefit to either party. Realistically, you use it to make yourself feel better by pointing out you know something they don't.

Instead, consider it a teaching opportunity. You can even transmute it into excitement, as you've got a great opening to teach.

The key is to not act surprised, even if you are actually surprised.
