# Specificity in CSS

> Specificity is an algorithm that calculates the weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration. The weight is determined by the number of [selectors of each weight category](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity#selector-weight-categories) in the selector matching the element (or pseudo-element).

> The specificity algorithm is basically a three-column value of three categories or weights - ID, CLASS, and TYPE - corresponding to the three types of selectors

ID column (x-0-0)
Includes only ID selectors.

CLASS column (0-x-0)
Class selectors, attribute selectors, and pseudo classes.

TYPE column (0-0-x)
Element type selectors and pseudo elements.

Once the specificity values of the relevant selectors are determined, the number of selector components in each column are compared, from left to right. Whichever selector has a higher value in the most left column wins. e.g. 1-0-0 beats 0-4-0.

If the competing selectors have the same values in all the three columns, the proximity rule comes into play, wherein the last declared style gets precedence.
