>Developers usually split their applications into multiple pages that can be accessed from different URLs. Each of these pages becomes a unique **entry point** into the application.
>Code-splitting is the process of splitting the applicationâ€™s bundle into smaller chunks required by each entry point. The goal is to improve the application's initial load time by only loading the code required to run that page.
