# `useId` hook

```jsx
const id = useId();
```

`useId` is a hook for generating unique IDs that are stable across the server and client, while avoiding hydration mismatches.

>`useId` generates a string that includes the `:` token. This helps ensure that the token is unique, but is not supported in CSS selectors or APIs like `querySelectorAll`.
