# IOPS vs Throughput

Both of these are performance measurements for storage devices, and each are important depending on your use case.

IOPS (I/O operations per second):
- **Number of read and write operations per second**
- Important metric for quick transactions, low-latency apps, transactional workloads

Throughput:
- **Measures the number of bits read or written per second (MB/s)**
- Important metric for large datasets, complex queries
