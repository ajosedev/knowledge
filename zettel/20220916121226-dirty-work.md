# Building your career on dirty work

>The Dirty Work Theory: The lamentable work that many people avoid are great places to look for high impact, low hanging fruit.

Looking for lamentable work opens more opportunity to find the low hanging fruit. If it's not the new shiny thing, there's probably less people trying to find solutions.

Additionally, any work that is bad enough to get a reputation is something that is inherently high impact if you can fix it. Solving people's problems is always a big win.
