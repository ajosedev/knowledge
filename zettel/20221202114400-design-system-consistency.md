# Consistency in Design Systems

'Consistency' in design systems sometimes has the connotation of monotony. Everything starts to look the same and creative expression is stifled. [[20221202114400-design-system-consistency]]

Swapping the word for another like 'unity' or 'cohesion' doesn't really fix the problem. The intent of changing the word is helpful though.

**Consistency does not have to equal uniformity.** The amount of consistency you want is flexible, and can change on a case-by-case basis.
