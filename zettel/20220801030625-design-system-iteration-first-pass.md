# Releasing first pass components in a design system

It's okay to agree on something to move things forward, rather than trying to solve all problems upfront.

It's okay to revise and iterate on an existing component, as long as that approach is communicated and understood by bother the maintainers and the consumers. This drives adoption and lets you understand use cases, rather than setting a bad decision in stone [[20220704124529-design-system-harvesting]].

When releasing a 'first pass' component, consider two approaches:
- There is no alignment on X, so lets avoid trying to solve X for now and omit it from the component
- We need to agree on X, so here's our best guess, and allow for feedback.

> Teams react better when there is a clear expectation. Be explicit about the decision (“this is our best guess”), sometimes we need to put things live and we don’t know the answers

> You have to build the idea into the company culture that it is OK to go back and change things, and the idea should be ingrained in the product teams.
