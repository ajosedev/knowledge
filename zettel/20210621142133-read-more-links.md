# 'read more...' links aren't accessible

By default screen readers won't get the context of what these links require. Instead of flowing through the paragraph and ending with a link, it may present as a list of links with nothing else than the 'more' text. Ideally these links should encapsulate more of the copy so they provide context, or use something like SR only text or labels to add additional context.
