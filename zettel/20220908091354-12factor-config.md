# 12 Factor: 3. Config
**Store config in the environment**

'Config' in this case encapsulates everything that varies between deploys. Keep configuration separated from code.

Twelve-factor apps store config in environment variables. Variables should be granular and [[20200307104931-orthogonality|orthogonal]]. Don't group multiple variables together as a single environment (e.g. switch using `NODE_ENV`). Individual variables for individual controls scales best.

A good litmus test to check for separate configuration is whether the codebase could be made open source without compromising credentials.

Ideally the app wouldn't even load its config - it just exists at the environment level.
