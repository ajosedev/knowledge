# Menu vs nav

A menu != nav.

Menus are for **application-like controls** (think of a desktop app), and a nav is for navigation.

This is true even for dropdown lists, as the top-level link for a submenu often acts as a discrete link, not just a menu button. The UI may look the same, but the UX is different as the taborder in a nav should be 'flat', featuring the top-level link the same as sub-menu links.
