# Make the change easy

>First make the change easy, then make the easy change

If you're making a change, but it's difficult to make it. Take a step back, and see why it's difficult. Does the code need to be organised better? Have the business requirements changed?

If so, do that first. Organise it, clean it up, refactor it, whatever else.

After that's done, your change should be easy.
