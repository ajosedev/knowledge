# Documenting components in a Design System

Good documentation requires planning, effort and process to make examples and guidelines that make a difference.
You need to build for an **audience**, figuring out what content and architecture they need.
The following is an overview for structuring your documentation.

## Audience
Focus on engineers and designers, but consider accessibility, product mangers, QA, etc.
Try to optimise for both engineers/designers, but consider slightly preferring engineers if they will probably refer to it more.
Code = final product, at the end of the day.

## Content
Four broad areas:
- Introduction
- Examples (variations, states, etc.) preferably powered by code
- Design reference (use cases, dos and donts, guidelines)
- Code reference (API, props, etc)

The priority will usually match the above order

## Architecture
Design & engineering overlap in the desired documentation, but each also have their own desires.
Be wary of splitting design/code information, as it's easy for them to get out of sync.
A single source of truth is ideal, but don't bore disciplines with info they don't care about.

## Threaded content
Blending the two disciplines together is definitely possible, and it can be solved in different ways:
- Stacked content, on one page
- Tabs
- Toggle between design/code
- 
For longer pages, add navigation helpers (e.g. scrolling table of contents)
