# Imperative vs declarative React

React is declarative. You describe the output through JSX and React takes care of implementing and rendering the desired result.

However, that doesn't mean that *all* code is declarative.

>Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and donâ€™t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.

Using the hook in a component is often still declarative, but the hook itself is usually written imperatively.
