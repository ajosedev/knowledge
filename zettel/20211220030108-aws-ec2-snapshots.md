# AWS S3 Snapshots

Snapshots exist on S3 and act as a point in time copy of the virtual disk/volume. They are incremental, so they only track the data that has been changed since the last snapshot. Thus, the first snapshot will be the longest/biggest.

Snapshots only capture data written to your EBS volume, which may exclude cached data (e.g. in RAM or in the application). Best practice for consistency is to stop the instance and take a snap.

If you take a snapshot of an encrypted [[20211220025859-aws-ebs-volumes|EBS volume]], the snapshot will be encrypted automatically.

You can share snapshots, but only in the region in which they were created. To share to other regions, you will need to copy (i.e. not share) the snapshot to that region first.
