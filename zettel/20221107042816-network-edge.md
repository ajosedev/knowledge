# Network edge

>For Internet devices, the network edge is where the device, or the local network containing the device, communicates with the Internet. The edge is a bit of a fuzzy term; for example a user’s computer or the processor inside of an IoT camera can be considered the network edge, but the user’s router, ISP, or local edge server are also considered the edge. The important takeaway is that the edge of the network is geographically close to the device, unlike [origin servers](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/origin-server/) and cloud servers, which can be very far from the devices they communicate with.
