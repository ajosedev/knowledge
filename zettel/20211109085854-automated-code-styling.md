# Automate code styling

Enforcing code styles through automated tooling is far more effective than a separate guide for engineers to follow. It requires less upkeep, less time, and is more pevalent in the engineer's editor, rather than separated from the code.

Additionally, automated fixing can be leveraged to avoid small disagreements on spacing etc, so engineers can spend more time writing the code that matters.

Tools like `eslint` and `prettier` are great for this.
