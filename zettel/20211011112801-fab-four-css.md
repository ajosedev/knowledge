# Fab four technique in CSS

Relies on the preference order of `width`, `min-width`, and `max-width`:
- If the _width_ value is greater than the _max-width_ value, _max-width_ wins.
- If the _min-width_ value is greater than the _width_ or _max-width_ values, _min-width_ wins.

Using this, we can create a responsive CSS snippet that doesn't rely on media queries.
The following snippet changes between using the `min-width` and `max-width` value depending on the width of the parent container.
    If it's greater than `480px`, width will equal -9600px, meaning `min-width` takes effect.
    If the parent is less than `480px`, width will equal 38400px, meaning `max-width` takes effect.

```css
.block {
    display:inline-block;
    min-width:50%;
    max-width:100%;
    width:calc((480px â€” 100%) * 480);
}
```

A similar strategy can be used with properties such as `border-radius`. The following snippet will swap between a `0px` and `8px` radius, depending on if the card width is greater than the viewport width. The 4px in this case is just some buffer room, it's not necessary for the logic to work.
```css
border-radius: max(0px, min(8px, calc((100vw - 4px - 100%) * 9999)));
```
