# Pairing typography

You pair typography, you don't just use one font for the entire site.

Some standard pairings are:
- One display and one sans-serif
- One serif and one sans-serif

Don't use more than three, it doesn't look good and it will slow down your site.

Don't pick types that are _too_ similar to each other.

Not all body fonts make good title fonts, and vice versa. Fonts work at different sizes.
