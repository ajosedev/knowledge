# Prop getters

Prop getters help you hand rendering control over the users of the components. It's a function that will return props when called, which must be applied to the correct elements. This allows the user to have the logic and control of a consistent component, while allowing them to change what is rendered to the page. e.g. a Toggle component that also allows control through a button.

The function can be extended to allow arguments, which can then be composed with the required props to hand even more control to the user. For example, this allows a user to add a custom `onClick` even if an `onClick` is returned from the function.

```javascript
// A generic helper to check if a function exists, and if it does, call it
const callAll = (...fns) => (...args) => fns.forEach(fn => fn?.(...args))

function getTogglerProps({onClick, ...props} = {}) {
    return {
        'aria-pressed': on,
        onClick: callAll(onClick, toggle),
        ...props,
    }
}

const {on, getTogglerProps, getResetterProps} = useToggle({
    reducer: toggleStateReducer,
})

return (
    <Switch
        {...getTogglerProps({
            disabled: clickedTooMuch,
            on: on,
            onClick: () => setTimesClicked(count => count + 1),
        })}
    />
)
```
