# Design systems enable change

Design systems really show their ROI when they help enable a large scale change. Think rebrands, mergers, brand updates, etc.

It's also the largest test of a design systems effectiveness. Most of the time a DS is used to improve the standard product release cycle. A major event like a rebrand shows how usable your design system really is.

A change that could take months or years now is a change that takes mere weeks. As these large changes are often unplanned, the time saved is an extra win for roadmaps.

> In summary, design systems prove their value most in how well they prepare your organization for change.
