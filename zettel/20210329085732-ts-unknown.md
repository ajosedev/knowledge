# Use `unknown` over `any` in Typescript

`unknown` is the type-safe variant of `any`. Both allow any values to be assigned to them, but `unknown` isn't assignable to anything, where as `any` is. This means that to use a variable of type `unknown`, it requires a type assertion or narrowing to a more specific type first.

Essentially this can be any value, but you must perform a type check before using it.
As a blanket rule, every `any` should be replaced with an `unknown`.

```javascript
let vAny: any = 10;          // We can assign anything to any
let vUnknown: unknown =  10; // We can assign anything to unknown just like any 


let s1: string = vAny;     // Any is assignable to anything 
let s2: string = vUnknown; // Invalid we can't assign vUnknown to any other type (without an explicit assertion)

vAny.method();     // ok anything goes with any
vUnknown.method(); // not ok, we don't know anything about this variable
```
