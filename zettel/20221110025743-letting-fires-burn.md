# Letting fires burn

>Years ago I heard someone say that leadership is about knowing which fires to let burn.

There will always be fires burning. Management is all about figuring out which ones you can stamp out, and which ones are worth ignoring so you can look to the future.

Even if the fire gets bigger over time, sometimes it makes sense to come back another time.
