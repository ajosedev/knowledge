# Integrating content design in a design system

Some good practices for documenting content design in your design system:
- Document design and content guidelines together - don't isolate content design elsewhere. It's just another part of the puzzle so keep it on the same level.
- Use realistic copy in examples. This is an easy win to provide better context and show how the component is used in product.
- Create a clear list of do's and dont's. This provides easy clarification, especially for non-UX writers.
- Consider inclusivity and accessibility.
- Be specific and focused about your guidelines. If there's a *must*, clearly state that it's a must, and not a recommendation.
