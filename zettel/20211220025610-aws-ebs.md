# AWS Elastic Block Storage (EBS)

Storage volumes you can attach to your EC2 instances-  essentially a virtual hard disk.

Useful for file systems, databases, OS, data, etc.
Designed for mission critical data.
Highly available, and scalable.

Different types of EBS volumes:
- General Purpose SSD (gp2) - a balance of price and performance. Good for boot volumes or development/test apps that are not latency sensitive
- General Purpose SSD (gp3) - high performance at a low cost: mysql, virtual desktops, etc.
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) - high performance and most expensive. Use if you need more than 16000 IOPS: large databases and latency sensitive workloads
- Provisioned IOPS SSD (io2) - A straight upgrade to io1
- Throughput Otimised HDD (st1) - Low-cost HDD volume, cannot be a boot volume
- Cold HDD (sc1) - Lowest cost option, good for colder data
