# Block scope in JS

Both `let` and `const` are **block** scoped. They only exist within the innermost block that surrounds them.
```js
function func() {
    if (true) {
        let tmp = 123;
    }
    console.log(tmp); // ReferenceError: tmp is not defined
}
```

In contrast, `var` variables are **function** scoped.
```js
function func() {
    if (true) {
        var tmp = 123;
    }
    console.log(tmp); // 123
}
```

This is partly what leads to the classic loop closure bug. [[20210426174851-closure-loops-js]]
