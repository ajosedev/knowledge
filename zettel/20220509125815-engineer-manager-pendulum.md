# Engineer manager pendulum

Alternatively, the engineering & management cycle.

Management is a change of profession, not just a promotion. It's a parallel track to engineering, so you're effectively becoming a junior again.
You'll be bad at it when you first start, but that's okay. To get better as a manager, you need manager skills, not IC skills.

However, the best managers are ones that know how to engineer. You need to know how to get stuff done. You need to know what you're talking about to the people you manage. Over time though, those engineering skills start to deteriorate.

Consider switching back and forth between the two - get the best of both worlds. Solve people problems, and then later solve code problems. Each profession helps with the other.

A key tip for keeping sharp on engineering while managing: **don't write code *in the critical path***.
