# Widows and Orphans

A **widow** is a very short line at the end of a paragraph or column.
A **orphan** is similar, but at the beginning of a column or page.

Having these in text make the text look worse, and even harder to read.

When dealing with an API, these can be difficult (or impossible) to fix.

Oddly enough, some definitions have these switched around.
