# Design System documentation taxonomy

How do you model your documentation for a design system? Often the documentation is wanted to be read from various places: code, design tools, documentation tools (e.g. Storybook), etc. How can you best write things in a method that keeps them [[20200307101703-easy-to-change]] but also easy to consume?

Take a single place such as documentation site. Contrast guides make sense to live in colours, or an accessibility section, or perhaps even in a theming section. How can you write this once but publish it to many different places?

Are we missing the tooling for this? Should we be writing documentation in the most agnostic manner and have build steps to publish it? gov.uk has docs in YAML, for example.
