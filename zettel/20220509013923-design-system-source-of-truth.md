# Source of truth in a design system

Assuming you are making a web product, the source of truth is inevitably frontend code. This is what your users are using, and is visible on the site. Bugs in code are real, bugs in Figma _can_ be ignored.

However this doesn't mean engineers are necessarily the primary audience. It can be argued that designers should be. Change at the design stage is much much cheaper, and often designers roles line up better with design system contributions. For example, they are more aware of gaps in the DS, or UI that doesn't work well, etc. Designers are trying to create solutions which often involves innovation or stretching the bounds of a design system. Engineers are just implementing those solutions. Facilitating feedback and opening discussions at that level can save you a lot of time in the long run.

That all being said, the primary audience for your _documentation_ may be different.
