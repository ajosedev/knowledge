# Splitting and modelling microfrontends

There are two ways of splitting microfrontends:
- Horizontal. Multiple microfrontends per page.
- Vertical. One microfrontend per business domain/page.

Vertical splitting is close to a standard SPA output, but with the benefits of a microfrontend architecture.

Each microfrontend may or may not be owned by the same team. It's generally best to model microfrontends around a business domain. This helps achieve a similar look and feel, domain knowledge is shared, etc.
