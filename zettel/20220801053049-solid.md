# SOLID

The SOLID principles of Object Oriented Design include these five principles:

Single Responsibility Principle [[20221010033955-single-responsibility-principle]]
Open/Closed Principle [[20221010034039-open-closed-principle]]
Liskov Substitution Principle [[20221010034050-liskov-substitution-principle]]
Interface Segregation Principle [[20221010034106-interface-segregation-principle]]
Dependency Inversion Principle [[20220801020727-dependency-inversion-principle]]

All of these principles aim to make code more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
Although originally created for OOP, they are applicable to software design generally.
