# Write small PRs

Make big changes through small, incremental PRs.

Small PRs:
- get reviewed quicker
- are safer, as they touch less code
- more easily reviewed
- show progress

You can have a different workflow that supports this. e.g. make all the changes in one branch, and then cherry pick independent parts. Or, try to make it independent from the get-go. Sometimes the former makes more sense, when you can't break down the problem initially.
