# Reverse proxy

A forward proxy sits between clients and the internet - it intercepts those requires then communicates with web servers on behalf of those clients. It's mainly used for additional anonymity, as well as avoiding blacklists/browsing restrictions.

A reverse proxy sits in between the internet and origin servers, intercepting requests from clients. Requests to the origin server are intercepted at the network edge, which sends requests and receive responses from the origin server. It's useful for protection from DDOS attacks, load balancing, caching, etc.

A forward proxy ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client. A reverse proxy ensures that no client ever communicates directly with that origin server.
