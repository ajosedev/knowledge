# Web platform tests (WPT)

>The web-platform-tests Project is a cross-browser test suite for the Web-platform stack.
>If the web platform as a whole were an engineering project, it'd be crazy not to have a test suite that's run regularly. The goal of the WPT Dashboard is to promote viewing the web platform as one entity and to make identifying and fixing interoperability issues as easy as possible.
