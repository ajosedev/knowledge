# Writing matters in remote work

Writing saves time.
> “Five people in a room for an hour isn’t a one hour meeting, it’s a five hour meeting.”

Writing is asynchronous, and non-disruptive. People can chime in on their own time.
Not everything can be solved asynchronously - use meetings as a last resort.

Writing removes extrovert bias, it allows quieter people time to gather their thoughts, and respond on an even playing field

Writing invites other perspectives, it forces you think clearly about what you are trying to say.
