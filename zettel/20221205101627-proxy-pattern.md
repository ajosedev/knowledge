# Proxy pattern

>Intercept and control interactions to target objects.
>
>With a Proxy object, we get more control over the interactions with certain objects. A proxy object can determine the behaviour whenever we're interacting with the object, for example when we're getting a value, or setting a value.

Useful to add more control to an object: validation, debugging, notifications, side-effects, etc.

However the extra invocations can add [[performance]] drawbacks.
