# Linear data structures
"Data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed", e.g. stacks, lists, queues

**List** - a collection of items where each item holds a relative position with respect to the others (_unordered list_). **add** adds a new item to the list, **remove** removes the item from the list, **search** searches for an item in the list, **append** adds a new item to the end of the list, **index** returns the position of item in the list, **insert** adds a new item to the list at a position, **pop** removes and returns the last item in the list

**Linked List** - contains a series of **nodes** where each stores data, and a reference to the next node. This helps it maintain a logical order.

**Stack** - Last in, first out. **push** adds an item to the top of the stack, **pop** removes the item off the top of the stack, **peek** returns but does not remove the item off the top of the stack.

**Queue** - First in, first out. **enqueue** adds a new item to the rear of the queue, **dequeue** removes the item from the front of the queue

**Deque** - double ended queue. Items can be added/removed at either the front, or the rear. **addFront/Rear** adds a new item to the front/rear of the queue, **removeFront/Rear** removes the item from the front/rear
