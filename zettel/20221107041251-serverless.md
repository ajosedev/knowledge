# Serverless computing

Serverless computing allows you to build and run applications and services without having to manage servers. Importantly, the services are provided on an as-used basis. Thus you're only charged for the amount of resources used to run the code. Effectively it's the next frontier for cloud computing.

Serverless handles the infrastructure for you. Things like automatic scaling, high availability, cost optimisation, etc are all handled for you. The developer focuses on writing the code, and the cloud provider handles running it.

Serverless architecture requires you to write in the form of functions. This in turn relies on a [[20221107045842-microservices]] style architecture. Code is executed in stateless containers that are triggered by various means, such as HTTP requests, database events, pubsub, etc. This also means that your code has to be written differently, you can't rely on the state of other things, nor the state of previous function calls.
