# Game feel, or 'juice'

>**Game feel** (sometimes referred to as "**game juice**") is the intangible, tactile sensation experienced when interacting with video games

>“Game feel” (a.k.a. “juice”) is the “aesthetic sensation of control” (Steve Swink, _Game Feel_) you have when playing a game.

Juice is what makes a game satisfying to play. It makes a jump feel like a mechanical robotic action, or a powerful leap.

Juice can be applied to regular design too. It makes something feel satisfying. It's not limited to big actions either, rote actions can benefit from juice.
