# 12 Factor: 6. Processes
**Execute the app as one or more stateless processes**

The app is executed in the execution environment as one or more _processes_.

Twelve-factor processes are stateless and share-nothing. Any data that needs to persist must be stored in a stateful backing service, typically a database.

The memory space or filesystem of the process can be used as a brief, single-transaction cache. Never assume that data will be there later. Future requests may be served by a different process, but even a single process could lose local state.

Don't rely on 'sticky sessions' where requests from a visitor is routed to the same process. Instead store the data you need.
