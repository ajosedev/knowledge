# The shared responsibility model in AWS

In cloud computing, some of the responsibilities are split. AWS have a model that helps split this.

AWS is responsible for 'Security **of** the cloud' - customer data, IAM, network configuration, etc
Customers are responsible for 'Security **in** the cloud' - software, storage, physical, broad networking, etc.

As a rule of thumb, if you can control it in the AWS management console, you are probably responsible for that area.
