# EC2 Networking

There are three different virtual networking cards that can be attached to EC2 instances.

**ENI (Elastic Network Interface)** - basic, day-to day.

Private & public IPv4 Address, and more.
Helpful to create a separate management network, or logging network, etc. Can use separate ENIs for each network.
Low-budget, high-availability solution.

**EN (Enhanced Networking)** - single root I/O virtualisation for high performance.

Higher bandwidth, higher packets per second.
10Gbps - 100Gbps
Can be used with ENA (newer, preferred) or VF (older).

**EFA (Elastic Fabric Adapter)** - high performance computing and ML applications.

Lower and more consistent latency than TCP.
Can use *OS-bypass*, which offers increased speed and lower latency by bypassing the OS kernel.
