# Infrastructure as Code

aka IAC

> Infrastructure as code is the approach to defining computing and network infrastructure through source code that can then be treated just like any software system

This has many benefits, including:
- Increasing transparency and visibility
- Keep things reproducible
- Automate common tasks
- Self-documentation
- Versioning, diffing, etc.
- Safer changes

This avoids manual processes, sometimes referred to as 'click ops'.
