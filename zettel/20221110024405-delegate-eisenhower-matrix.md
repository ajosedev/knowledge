# Delegating with the Eisenhower Matrix

The Eisenhower Matrix is a simple tool to help prioritise tasks on your plate. Plot work based on what's true, not what you 'should' be doing. Be realistic if you want proper results.

## Do now
If it's important, and it's urgent, get it done. Simple.
If there's too much in this quadrant, see what you can move to 'say no' or 'delegate'

## Say no
If you're not comrfortable outright saying no, put it on your backlog, a sticky note, or something that you can get to later. If you don't get to it, no big deal

## Schedule for later or delegate
Put it on a list, or delegate it if there's a good opportunity

## Delegate
If you can pass it someone else, try to. Get things off your plate when you can, and if it's a good opportunity for others.
