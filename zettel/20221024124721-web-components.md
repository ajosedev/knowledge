# Web components

> Web Components is a suite of different technologies allowing you to create reusable custom elements — with their functionality encapsulated away from the rest of your code — and utilize them in your web apps.

As they are native to the web, they can be used in any web-based environment. They are framework independent.

Web components house the main meat of components - markup, styles, and any required (Javascript) behaviour.

There are three main technologies:
- Custom elements: lets you define custom HTML elements and their behavour
- Shadow DOM: Javascript APIs for an encapsulated DOM tree tied to the element. Keeps things private and self contained
- HTML templates: `<template>` and `<slot>` lets you write markup that aren't displayed on the rendered page.

Once you've built a Web Component, they can be used like regular HTML elements that accept attributes:
```html
<product-card imgSrc="img.jpg"></product-card>
```
