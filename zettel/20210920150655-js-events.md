# Events in Javascript

Events go through three phases:

**Capture phase**: events traverse _down_ through elements checking for event handlers on each handler, calling it if it exists (starts at `html` and then its descendents)
**Target phase**: browser checks to see if the target property has an event handler for the event registered
**Bubbling phase**: the opposite of the capture phase, with events traversing up (starts at the element and then its ascendents)

The default for an event listener is to register for the _bubbling_ phase.
Default: bubble

This traversal is known as propagation, with events propagating both up and down. `stopPropagation` stops an event from propagating when called, effectively ending its traversal regardless of direction. i.e. stopping during the capture phase will prevent the bubble phase entirely.

`stopImmediatePropagation` stops the propagation happening for the _same_ element, which is only helpful when there is more than one event handlers tied to it. Event handler #1 (defined first) can stop #2 from being called.

`preventDefault` is different from the event traversal entirely - it stops the default action of the element, e.g. prevent a `a` from navigating.
