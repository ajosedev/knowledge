# Bitwise operators

`>>`and `<<`are shift operators. They are common across languages such as C, PHP, and Go.

Go in particular makes the operation slightly safer, but the simplified version is that shift all bits of a number left/right, by the amount given.

`<<` is 'times 2', and`>>` is 'divided by 2', x amount of times.

For example, `1 << 4` is `1` times 2, `4`times. Which is `16`.
