# Strategies for landing a design system into an existing product

Three broad strategies to driving adoption of your design system in an existing product. This often presents a different challenge to starting from the ground up, as you're trying to actively replace code at rest too.

**Blow it up**
The classic 'big bang', change everything at once.
Usually doesn't work in a similar vein to other 'big bang' approaches: risk is high, code gets out of sync, etc.

**Ship of Thesus**
Consistent specific replacements over time.
Swap all components for newer components gradually. Hard for big breakthroughs and is quite time consuming. Necessitates having 1:1 swaps as anything that doesn't fit into your new design system presents problems. Also increases inconsistency.

**Land & Expand**
As your customer uses the product, you add more value and slowly expand over time.
Akin to a scoped version of a 'big bang', you redesign by a section, not by a component. Helps you test things end-to-end in a controlled environment. Over time, your scope expands until you're consistently changing sections of the existing product.
