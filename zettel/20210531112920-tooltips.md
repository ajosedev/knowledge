 /# Tooltips and their problems

Tooltips are a visual pattern, not a functional pattern.

Hover cards, form tooltips, icon tooltips are all used in different ways. How they work is dependent on what they are tied to, rather than some inbuilt semantic meaning. For example, they are sometimes used as a description, other times a label/title.

Tooltips are hard to make work on mobile - hover/focus doesn't realy apply there.
