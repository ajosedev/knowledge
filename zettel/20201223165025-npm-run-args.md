# NPM run args

`npm run` passes args to the underlying command, only if they don't have any dashes. Otherwise, these args are passed to `npm`.

Thus any args starting with `-`, e.g. `--watch=true`, need to be passed after a `--`. 

e.g.
`npm run jest --watch fileName` will pass fileName, won't pass --watch
`npm run jest -- --watch fileName` will pass fileName AND --watch
