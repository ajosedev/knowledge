# Symmetry

Symmetry is easier, and it's neat and organised, but it can sometimes be a little boring. A break in symmetry can be used to draw the eye to a particular location.

Asymmetry is harder, but it's usually more interesting and distinct.

Breaking symmetry is much like breaking grids in design, it brings visual interest.
