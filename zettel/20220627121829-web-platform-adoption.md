# Keeping things closer to the web platform

#todo - rework this doc

Keeping things closer to the web platform helps users adopt features, [[designsystem|design systems]], products, etc.

It's easier for new people to come in and learn your system if they don't have to re-learn core web tenets. This is less visible at a small scale, especially if engineers have always done it similarly at your company. However, new engineers will inevitably come in and find it more confusing.

As an example, using something like CSS custom properties over SASS mixins. Users can rely on existing knowledge of how they work, and how to break out of them if required.

It's easier to clearly communicate concepts when they relate to something already known.
