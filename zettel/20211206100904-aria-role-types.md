# ARIA role types

There are 6 categories of ARIA roles

## Abstract roles
Not to be used in content, these support the WAI-ARIA role taxonomy for defining general role concepts.
Some examples:
- command
- input
- range
- section

## Widget roles
Define common interactive patterns. Some of these duplicate the semantics of native HTML elements and thus should be avoided.
Some examples:
- combobox
- switch
- tab
- treeitem

Some examples to avoid:
- button
- checkbox
- option
- radio

Some of these are considered 'composite widgets'.

## Document structure roles
Describe structures that organise content in a page. These are usually not interactive. Most of these should not be used in favour of semantic HTML elements.
Some examples:
- toolbar
- tooltip
- note

Some examples to avoid:
- article
- list
- separator
- table

## Landmark roles

## Live region roles
These are live regions, i.e. their content will be dynamically changed and announced to screen readers.
Some examples:
- alert
- log
- status

## Window roles
Act as sub-windows to the main document window, such as pop up modal dialogs.
Some examples:
- alertdialog
- dialog
