# IAM basics in AWS

**IAM** = Identity Access Management
Allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console. It is region-agnostic.

There are three types of identities:
- Users - should represent 1 physical person
- User groups - functions such as admin, developer, finance, etc.
- Roles - allows one part of AWS to access another part of AWS [[20211206015943-aws-iam-roles]]

Best practice is for users to inherit permissions from user groups. Creating a user and not assigning it to any groups or tags will create a user without any permissions at all.

The [[20211122011239-aws-root-account|root account]] is the email addressed that signed up for AWS. It has full admin access and needs to be secured.

[[20211122012856-aws-policies|Policy documents]] control IAM permissions, and are written in JSON.

Note that access key and secret access key != username/password, but are instead used for programatic access. The secret access key is only shown once, and either key shouldn't be shared.

It's best practice to set up a forced password rotation if using passwords.
