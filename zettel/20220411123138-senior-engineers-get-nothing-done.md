# Why senior engineers get nothing done

As you gain more knowledge, you become more helpful to other engineers. Instead of writing code, you start to help others write code. Note: make sure your manager understands this too - this is part of your work and should be rewarded.
You become a force multiplier. Minutes of your time save hours for other engineers.

To help protect your time and use it most efficiently, there's two strategies:
Timeboxing - block off your calendar so you can get certain things done, e.g. 'focus time'.
Optimisation - when someone asks you a question, document the answer. Next time someone asks you the same question, you can just re-give the same answer.
