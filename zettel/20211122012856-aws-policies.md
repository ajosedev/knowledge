# Policy documents in AWS

Policy documents control IAM permissions, and are written in JSON. They can be applied to groups, user groups, or roles. Amazon offers many managed policies, indicated by the icon in the policy list.

Policy documents are made up of statements which include information about a single permission. The main parts are the *EAR*:
- Effect (allow/deny)
- Action
- Resource (which the actions apply to)

Inline policies are applied to one user or one group, useful for one-offs.
