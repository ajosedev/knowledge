# How to give feedback
How to give feedback:
1.  Establish a good working relationship
2.  Ensure a common understanding of good intentions
3.  Focus on the work, not the person
4.  Ask clarifying questions
5.  Make suggestions as questions (Have you tried X?)
6.  Explain your reasoning

Using suggestions as questions is odd but it works for two main reasons:
1. The person can save face and take ownership
2. It may have been tried and didn't work

When needed, it pays to be direct. If the plane is about to crash, communicate the problem straight.
