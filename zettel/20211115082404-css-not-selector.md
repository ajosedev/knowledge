# :not selector

> The `:not()` CSS pseudo-class represents elements that do not match a list of selectors. Since it prevents specific items from being selected, it is known as the negation pseudo-class.

`<selector to match>:not(<selector to avoid matching>)`

This can be useful for creating specific selectors that rely on other selectors not being present at the time, e.g `input:not(:focus)` or `input:not(:disabled)`.

You can negate several selectors at the same time. Example: `:not(.foo, .bar)` is equivalent to `:not(.foo):not(.bar)`.

Interestingly, this also allows you to create a [[20220627095528-donut-scope]].
