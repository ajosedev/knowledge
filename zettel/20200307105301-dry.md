# DRY

It's more concerned with **knowledge/intent duplication** than code duplication.
- The test for DRY is to make a change, and see how many places and formats you have to make that change in
- Don't duplicate code into documentation either - explicit documentation that needs to be changed when the code is changed is somewhat pointless
- don't duplicate data either, calculate fields based on other fields, rather than duplicating
