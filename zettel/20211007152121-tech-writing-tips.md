# Tech writing tips

TODO - over time, can break this out into individual posts

---

Explain things directly
    Don't add fluff words that aren't necessary (easy, simple, just, etc)
    Don't say it's easy, show them it's easy

Use plain language
    Makes your text more relatable and concise

Write in active voice
    Makes your text direct
    After the file is downloaded -> After you download the file

Organise content with lists, tables, and headlines
    Makes your text easier to parse

Get a peer review
    Extra eyes helps avoid mistakes
    
Get to the point quickly, that's what people care about

Write to someone who has no idea what you do.
    People may not have context, but they should still be able to understand what you're trying to convey
    
Fewer commas. More periods.
