Explain things directly
Don't add fluff words that aren't necessary (easy, simple, just, etc)
Don't say it's easy, show them it's easy

Use plain language
Keep it simple
Makes your text more relatable and concise
Don't convince someone with language, be persuasive through structure/framing.

Write in active voice
Whether the sbuject in a sentence *acts* (active voice) or is *acted on* (passive voice). The former is more direct and gives your writing authority and purpose.

Organise content with lists, tables, and headlines
Makes your text easier to parse

Get a peer review
Extra eyes helps avoid mistakes

Get to the point quickly, that's what people care about

Write to someone who has no idea what you do.
People may not have context, but they should still be able to understand what you're trying to convey

Fewer commas. More periods.

Don't use adverbs, replace the adverb + verb with a better verb instead.

Look out for sentences starting with ‘There is’ or ‘There are’ as you can often rewrite them for more clarity.
	‘There are no studies that have examined this effect’ can be rewritten as ‘No studies have examined this effect’.

Recast ‘of the’ constructions as possessive
Overuse of ‘of the’ in a sentence can result in sluggish writing, which can interrupt the flow. This can simply be fixed by recasting as possessive.
	‘We sought the perspectives of the students’ can be recast as ‘We sought students’ perspectives’.

Avoid overuse of ‘that’ in a sentence
I’ve found in some scholarly writing, authors often overuse the word ‘that’, which can make a sentence seem long-winded and unwieldy. They can often be removed with no other changes.

Writing is critical ar larger organisations because messages reach a bigger audience. For engineers, writing is a mean to reach, converse with, and influence engineers and teams outside their immediate peer group.

Re-read your writing by putting yourself in the recipient's shoes. This helps nail the tone, contents, context, etc.

Be concise. Shorter sentences, less distracting elements, etc. The longer the writing, the more tiring it is for readers. https://hemingwayapp.com/

A picture is worth a thousand words. This also applies to technical writing.

Value the reader's time more than your own. This saves time overall too [[20211203043016-writing-saves-time]]

Ask for feedback before publishing your writing. Another pair of eyes always helps. When facilitating feedback, ask people directed questions.

Longer examples:

‘The participant stated that she felt that she needed to carefully plan her lessons to ensure that her questioning techniques were improved’.
->
‘The participant stated she felt the need to plan her lessons to ensure she improved her questioning techniques’.

## How to Change Voice from Passive to Active  

If you can find the subject and [verb](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/verbs/what-is-a-verb.html) in a sentence, you change the voice in your sentence. Let's use the following example to understand how to change passive voice to active voice: "**The children were instructed by the teacher.**" Use these steps to work your sentence through a passive to active voice converter.

### Step One: Find the Action of the Sentence

What action is happening in the sentence? Someone (the subject) is instructing someone else (the object). The past tense verb **instructed** is part of the [verb phrase](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/verb-phrase-examples.html) **were instructed** in this sentence.

### Step Two: Find the Subject of the Sentence

In passive sentences, the subject may end up at the end of the sentence, or it may be missing altogether. The person instructing, the **teacher**, comes after the verb. If it were missing from the sentence, it would read "The children were instructed."

### Step Three: Put the Subject Before the Verb

Once you've found the subject and the verb, put them together. So far, you've got "The teacher were instructed." But that doesn't sound right. Fix the [verb tense](https://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/verbs/english-verb-tenses.html) to say "**The teacher instructed**."

### Step Four: Put the Object Where It Belongs

Who did the teacher instruct? The children receive the action (instructing) in this sentence, making "the children" the [object](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/direct-object-examples.html). Put the object right after the verb where it belongs: "**The teacher instructed the children.**" Now you have a sentence in active voice!
