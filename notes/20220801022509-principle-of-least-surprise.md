# Principle of Least Surprise

> If a necessary feature has a high astonishment factor, it may be necessary to redesign the feature

Things should work the way the user expects them to work, or they will experience frustration and/or confusion.

'Magic' is sometimes nice, but when you need to know what's going on and you can't change it (or figure it out), it just becomes frustrating again.

Also known as the 'Principle of Least Astonishment'.
