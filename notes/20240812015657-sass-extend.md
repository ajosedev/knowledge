# Extending in SASS

Using the `@extend` keyword in SASS can be a little bit 'dangerous', as it often creates slightly unexpected outcomes. As an example, consider the following:
```scss
.foo {
    color: red;
}

.footer .foo {
    font-weight: bold;
}

.bar {
    @extend .foo;
}
```

Compiles to:
```css
.foo, .bar {
    color: red;
}

.footer .foo, .footer .bar {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```

**Using @extend extends every instance of the extended class**. This can mean that you accidentally extend a class and create unwanted definitions, or even have a good solution now, but one that is unmaintainable and breaks elsewhere.

Thus a good rule of thumb is to only extend placeholder selectors, marked with a `%`. This provides a more predictable output when using `@extend`.

Personally, I prefer to use mixins most of the time, which are a bit more declarative IMO.
