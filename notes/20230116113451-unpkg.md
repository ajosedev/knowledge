# unpkg

Unpkg is an open-source [[20221107042836-cdn|cdn]] for everything on [[npm]].

Rather than needing to use a package.json and npm to add a dependency to a project, you can use unpkg + a `script` element to accomplish the same thing.

Because of the way unpkg works, you are able to specify down to the file level. You don't have to load the entire dependency.

```js
<script src="https://unpkg.com/d3" />
<script src="https://unpkg.com/d3@5.5.0/dist/d3.min.js" />
```

It's recommended to pin a [[20220509012212-semantic-versioning|version]] to avoid breaking changes.

It's also great for viewing the source of different packages without having to download them, e.g: https://unpkg.com/browse/react@18.2.0/package.json
