# Using fpp to act on files

`fpp` (Facebook PathPicker) helps you pick files out of a bash output. Any command can be piped to it, allowing you to pick a file from a `rg`, `git`, etc.

e.g. `git status | fpp`

Files can be opened (`enter`), or further commands can be run (`c`) on the files selected

e.g. `git status | fpp` -> select a file -> `c` -> `cat`
