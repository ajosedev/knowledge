# Overflow hidden vs clip

`clip` is a new value for `overflow` that is similar to `hidden`. However, using `overflow: hidden` even on a single axis, will always dictate that the other axis is scrollable.

`clip` does not have this behaviour, meaning you can restrict content on one axis without affecting the other. Note that this also disables programmatic scrolling.

`overflow-clip-margin` also exists to dictate the space between the element and where the clipping begins.
