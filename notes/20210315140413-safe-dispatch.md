# Creating a safe dispatch function

When dealing with async code, the `dispatch` function often fires at the end of a promise, where the component/reducer its working with may already been unmounted. If this is the case, an error is thrown, as React is trying to act on state for a component that does not already exist. To solve this, a wrapper around the `dispatch` function can be used:

```jsx
function useSafeDispatch(dispatch) {
  const mounted = React.useRef(false)

  React.useLayoutEffect(() => {
    mounted.current = true
    return () => (mounted.current = false)
  }, [])

  return React.useCallback(
    (...args) => (mounted.current ? dispatch(...args) : void 0),
    [dispatch],
  )
}
```
