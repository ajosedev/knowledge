# LNO Effectiveness Framework

Not all tasks are created equal. Different types of tasks have different amounts of value.

Leverage (10x): Do a great job. Let your inner perfectionist shine.

Neutral (1x): Do a strictly good job. No better.

Overhead (<1x): Just get it done. Actively try to do a bad job.

You want to keep as much time open for the work that matters most.
