# Web Platform Baseline

Baseline is an attempt to provide a more more simple answer to browser support for features. It marks when something is available to use based on multiple browsers.

Baseline has three stages:

- **Limited availablity:** The feature is not available in all the core browsers.
- **Newly available:** The feature becomes supported by all of the core browsers, and is therefore interoperable.
- **Widely available:** 30 months has passed since the newly interoperable date. The feature can be used by most sites without worrying about support.


The core browser set:
- Chrome (desktop and Android)
- Edge
- Firefox (desktop and Android)
- Safari (macOS and iOS)
