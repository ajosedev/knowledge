# Ranges in Vim

Ranges are applied to commands to specify what is affected by the command. Multiple line specifiers can be separated by a comma.

Useful ranges are:
- `<number>` - line number
- `.` - current line (usually the default range)
- `$` - last line of the current buffer
- `%` - current file
- `*` - last selection in visual mode

Ranges also support arithmetic, e.g. `.+10` will be the current line, plus 10.

`'<` and `'>`  are also ranges, as used in [[20210531165731-vim-search-replace-visual]]. The former represents the first line selected, and the latter the last line.

Ranges can be used as such:
- `:1,40d` - delete line 1 to 40
- `:%d` - delete every line
- `.,.+10` - delete current line to current line plus 10
