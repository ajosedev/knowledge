# display: flow-root

`display: flow-root` is very similar to `display: block`, but it creates a new block formatting context with flow layout formatting.

This is helpful for two main things:
1. It's a better solution to `clearfix`, when using `float`
2. Fixes issues with [[20230116021937-margin-collapse]], especially in the parent/child collapse situation.
