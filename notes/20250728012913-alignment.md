# The importance of alignment

I think alignment is one of the more important things of becoming a more senior engineer, or anyone in software development (cross-discipline included!).

Misalignment breeds frustration, stress, inefficiency, poor end results, etc etc. You cannot arrive at the correct solution if you're not aligned on the solution first.

That's why I think cross discipline work is so crucial too. It's worth spending a lot of extra time in the beginning to ensure alignment. You'll reap the rewards throughout the project.
