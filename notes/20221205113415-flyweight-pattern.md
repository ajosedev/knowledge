# Flyweight pattern

>Reuse existing instances when working with identical objects

Rather than creating a new object for every piece of data, share common parts of the data in a singular object. A single object uses far less memory than many objects, especially if they're storing duplicated data.

This pattern becomes more useful the more objects you have.
