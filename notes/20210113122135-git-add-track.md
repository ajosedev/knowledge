# Track but don't stage files in Git

`git add -N` can be used to track new files in Git without staging them. This can be helpful when adding commits with `git add -p` as it doesn't show untracked files.

I believe this is part of `ivy`, although I'm not confident. https://oremacs.com/swiper/#key-bindings-for-single-selection-action-then-exit-minibuffer
