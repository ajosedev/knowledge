# The Sidebar layout

Two columns side by side, which switches to a single column at a specified width. The width is based on the size of the element, not the size of the screen.

Given the following DOM:
```html
<div class="with-sidebar">
  <div><!-- sidebar --></div>
  <div><!-- non-sidebar --></div>
</div>
```

The CSS can look like the following. `min-inline-size` can be changed to whatever value you want the content to wrap at:
```css
.with-sidebar {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  gap: 1rem;
}

.sidebar {
  /* ↓ The width when the sidebar _is_ a sidebar */
  flex-basis: 20rem;
  flex-grow: 1;
}

.not-sidebar {
  /* ↓ Grow from nothing */
  flex-basis: 0;
  flex-grow: 999;
  /* ↓ Wrap when the elements are of equal width */
  min-inline-size: 50%;
}
```

As always, extra rules can make this more powerful. Using `min-width` and `max-width` together on the `.not-sidebar` class can prevent the inner content from growing, while the sidebar changes as needed.

The `.sidebar` `flex-basis` can be omitted to create an intrinsic sidebar width.

Every Layout calls this the 'Sidebar' layout.
