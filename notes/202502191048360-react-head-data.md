# Setting Document Metadata/Stylesheets in React

React 19 can now render document metadata tags in any component, negating the need for something like `react-helmet`. Tags are hoisted to the `head` section of the document.

It also has better support for both externally linked and inline stylesheets. `link` tags can be rendered in any component and accept a `precedence` attribute to help manager the insertion order. Like metadata tags, these are hoisted to the `head` as well.

During Client Side Rendering React will wait for newly rendered stylesheets to load before committing the render. If you render this component from multiple places within your application React will only include the stylesheet once in the document
