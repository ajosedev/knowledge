# Planning is important

Senior+ engineers focus on thinking ahead, planning work, alignment, among other things. Less on individual contribution and 'real work' (i.e. coding).

Remember that this work is important. This is where your value is! Hours of planning can save weeks of coding.

>The coding may be slowing you down! A bottleneck to your value. You'll have a much bigger impact by getting 5 engineers aligned and pulling in the same direction than by trying to do the work yourself.

> My job is not to build a winning car for next race. My job is to create a system that builds a winning car for every race.
