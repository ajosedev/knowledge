# Prefer semantic HTML over ARIA

Use semantic HTML elements like `nav` over creating your own with roles, etc.

Native elements have more built-in than just a `role`, they feature keyboard accessibility, state, etc. As an example, think of a `<button>` vs `role="button"`.

A full list of implicit ARIA semantics can be found in https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/
