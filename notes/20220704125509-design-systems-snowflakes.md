# Design system snowflakes

Snowflakes are one-off components that are used sparingly, often for a single page. These often break out of your design system [[20220801105616-break-out-design-system]]

These components are vital for your overall design system health. It makes sense for components to exist that fulfil needs but can't initially, or won't ever be abstracted into a generic component included in a design system.

To better identify trends, snowflakes can be tracked or exist in a specific place so they can be periodically audited. [[20220704124529-design-system-harvesting]]

Ideally over time the amount of 'one offs' or 'snowflakes' lowers, as the design system offers more solutions for these.
