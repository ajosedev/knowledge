# Context switching takes time

Switching between tasks can add a lot of time to finishing tasks.

Given two tasks, with a context switching time of 5 minutes. If you switch between the tasks 10 times, you've almost wasted an hour of time.

Over the course of a long task or project, you could be losing large amounts of time.

The key takeaway: don't let people work on more than one thing at a time.
