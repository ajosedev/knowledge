# Incentives vs disincentives

Incentives often compete with other incentives. Other incentives can become distractions for the incentive you want to push.

Incentives can also bring on side-effects that you don't anticipate. People respond differently.

With increasing variety, each incentive becomes weaker. However, disincentives remain powerful.

For example, wanting incentivise more collaboration and experimentation, but people don't have time in their calendar, and hard deadlines that stifle creation.

When you want to change behaviour, remove obstacles and blockers rather than push for the behaviour you want.
