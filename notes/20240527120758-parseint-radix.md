# ParseInt radix

Always use a radix with [[js]] `parseInt`.

```js
parseInt(number, radix)
```

The radix sets the 'base', which you usually want to be decimal (base 10).

If you don't use a radix, the default is considered to be `8`. For numbers that start with a `0`, this will lead to them being treated as an octal, where something like `010` is `8`, not `10`.
