# Creating helpful keyword bookmarks in Firefox

This helps you create a keyword for part of a site, letting you fill out the rest as part of a 'search'.

For example saving a documentation site with the keyword of `vd`.

e.g. `vd button` -> `https://vista.design/swan/components/button/`
e.g. `vd selection-set` -> `https://vista.design/swan/components/selection-set/`

This can be done with anything, e.g. `mdn` https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/bookmarks-firefox#w_how-to-use-keywords-with-bookmarks

You can do this with any site, just edit the bookmark with a `Keyword` and use `%s` in the URL for the replacement string.

Not sure if this is also possible in Chrome.
