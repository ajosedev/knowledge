```
In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called _web apps_, or _software-as-a-service_. The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

-   Use **declarative** formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
-   Have a **clean contract** with the underlying operating system, offering **maximum portability** between execution environments;
-   Are suitable for **deployment** on modern **cloud platforms**, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
-   **Minimize divergence** between development and production, enabling **continuous deployment** for maximum agility;
-   And can **scale up** without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.
