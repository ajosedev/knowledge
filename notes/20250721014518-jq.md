# jq

`jq` is a really useful tool for reading and manipulating JSON.

It's very powerful in the right hands, but it's a tool that needs learning, as the formatting and inputs can get pretty complex.

Something that's generally helpful is formatting JSON:
```sh
jq . file.json
```
This can also be done in [[vim]] directly with `:%!jq .`

[[shell]]
