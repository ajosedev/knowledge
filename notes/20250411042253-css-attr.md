# CSS attr attribute

The modern `attr` attribute adds a lot more functionality than the former one. Previously you could only use text, but now you can support different types.
```css
attr(data-color, type(<color>), red)
```

We can check for the modern attr() support with CSS `@supports`. Here is an example:

```css
@supports (x: attr(x type(*))) {
  /* modern attr() works */
}
```

This lets you pass a lot more information from HTML to CSS, which historically has different problems with different methods. e.g. this could be used to pass React props to CSS without having to use [[20231101113023-css-variables]] or classes.

This method also involves [[js]] entirely.
