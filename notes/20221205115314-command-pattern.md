# Command pattern

>With the Command Pattern, we can decouple objects that execute a certain task from the object that calls the method.

Requests become stand-alone objects that contain necessary information about the request. That way requests can be passed around to various methods, allowing the execution to be decoupled from the call.

The decoupling gives you more control about how and when you execute the command. This could involve queueing, delaying execution, dealing with concurrency, etc.
