# Emacs prefix keys
`C-x` is a prefix key that often allows for many other commands in Emacs. These commands are always active (similar to `M-x`), meaning they can be used while in an interactive buffer.

Other prefix keys include `C-c`, `C-h`, `C-x`.

Using `C-h` after invoking a prefix key displays a list of commands starting with that prefix. `F1` key can also be used. Helpful for getting a searchable list in the minibuffer

For example, to switch windows while in an interactive minibuffer you can use `C-x o`.
