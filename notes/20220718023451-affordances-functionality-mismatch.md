# Mismatch between affordances and functionality

Try to keep an element's affordances the same as its functionality. Don't create a mismatch between what a user expects and what they can actually do.

Given a button group that's coded like a radio group. Sighted users that expect to be able to tab through them, or otherwise treat them as buttons. Note that this also applies to sighted screen reader users, who expect different shortcuts.

> Be consistent: Use familiar conventions and apply them consistently.
