# Flexibility vs constraints in Design Systems

You don't need to have a constrained design system to have a consistent product. Flexibility is not always the enemy. In fact, an inflexible design system is often less desirable to use.

Design systems should enable real problem-solving, rather than just restricting creativity [[Yesenia Perez-Cruz - Scenario-Driven Design Systems]]. Often the way to increase consistency is by instilling a culture, rather than constraint. Constraints are sometimes seen as a trust issue - you don't trust your users to do the right thing when they have options.

Designers and engineers aligned towards a singular goal enables you to create a flexible design system that enables innovation without lowering consistency.
