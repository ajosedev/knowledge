# Margin collapse

In [[css]], adjacent margins can sometimes overlap due to something called 'margin collapse'. The rules around it are a little confusing, and often means developers opt into using something more consistent such as padding.

However it is a feature that can be tamed, and knowing how to use it sometimes comes in handy. For example, Capsize applies negative margins in combination with `display: table` to pseudo elements to avoid margin collapse.

Some hard and fast rules:
- Only vertical margins can collapse
- Only adjacent elements collapse - elements between will prevent it, even if empty
- The resulting margin collapse value will always be the bigger margin
- Margins can collapse, even if the elements are nested
- Margins can collapse in the same direction. Similarly, more than two margins can collapse
- Margins don't collapse in all [[20220815043921-layout-modes-css]], e.g. [[cssgrid]] and [[flexbox]].
- If an element has a top and bottom margin but is empty, the margins applied to that element will collapse.
