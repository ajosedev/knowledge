# Hydration

Hydration is essentially checking the current DOM nodes, and making the nodes interactive with the corresponding Javascript.

This is done on the client after using something like [[20220912120502-server-side-rendering]] or even [[20221128051011-static-rendering]]. The server sends plain HTML, and the client makes it interactive.
