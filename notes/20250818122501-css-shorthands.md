# CSS shorthands

Things like `font` or `background` can be sometimes problematic.

The key thing to remember is that setting a shorthand effectively sets every property in said shorthand.

Meaning that if you have a more specific selector, and set a shorthand property, it will overwrite things, usually unintentionally.

```css
div {
	margin-bottom: 20px;
	background-clip: content-box;
}

.class {
	margin: 0 auto;
	background: red;
}
```
```html
<div class="class">Content</div>
```
In the above example, `margin-bottom` and `background-clip` now have no effect.
