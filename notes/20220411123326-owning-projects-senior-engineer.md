# Owning projects like a senior engineer

Ownership is about overcoming obstacles. You're the one that figures out how to get around them. If you can't, remember that it's okay to ask for help too.

When trying to overcome an obstacle, there's a difference between excuses and reasons. You're responsible for the **outcome**, so if something gets in your way you can't just pack it up and go home. No key for the office? Figure out where the backup is.

Similarly, it's your job to solve problems, not fulfil pre-set requirements. If given a task, ask questions that may not have been asked. Get more context on the issue, why is this a task, is there a better solution?

Just because you're responsible for this project doesn't mean you have to micromanage everything though. Don't do it alone, and don't sweat the small details - you don't have to build every component.

>When designing systems and writing code, focus on what you're trying to achieve. Not just the current task at hand.

**Own the outcome, not the work.**
