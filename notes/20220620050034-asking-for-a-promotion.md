# How to ask for a promotion

Summary.   

First, reflect on what you want. Is there a job you covet or do you wish to create a new role? Do you want to move up—or might a lateral move interest you? Answering these questions helps you position your request. Second, build a case. Prepare a memo that outlines your strengths, recent successes, and impact. Next, talk to your boss and make your intentions clear. Beware that asking for a promotion is rarely a one and done discussion; rather, it’s a series of ongoing conversations. Your objective is to plant the seed and then nurture that seed over time. Finally, don’t get discouraged if you don’t get what you want right away. Continue to do good work and look for ways to elevate the level at which you operate.

Consider timing.

There’s no perfect time to ask for a promotion, but you should be savvy about when you make the request

Do some research.

It’s smart to gather outside intelligence too, says Nawaz. “The more senior you get, the more likely it is that your promotion is not the sole decision of your manager,” she notes. “Your manager’s peers have input as well.”

## Principles to Remember

### Do:

-   Think about the position you want and how it [aligns with the objectives](https://hbr.org/2017/02/how-aligned-is-your-organization) of your organization and manager.
-   Prepare a memo that clearly outlines your proven track record and provides concrete metrics on the impact you’ve had.
-   Ask your boss for regular feedback and advice on how you can get to the next level.

### Don’t:

-   Assume that asking for a promotion is a one-and-done discussion. It is usually a series of ongoing conversations.
-   Play the “other offer” card recklessly. That tactic often has a negative impact on professional relationships.
-   Get discouraged if you don’t get what you want right away. Be patient

# Understand the company’s promotion system

In many companies, to be promoted to the next level means that you need to demonstrate that you are already performing at that level. The artifact that comes handy is a job level and expectation document. Knowing what your company expects of you helps you build a narrative that ties your existing impact to the business guidelines and requirements.

# Compile a list of accomplishments and impact

Be ready to give specific examples of why you deserve the promotion. What are the achievements that demonstrate your growth and readiness for the promotion? What is your impact, and can you quantify it? What are your unique skills and knowledge that can contribute to the success of the new role?
