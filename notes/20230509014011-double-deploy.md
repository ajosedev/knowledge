# The double deploy problem

The double deploy problem is usually seen with frontend architectures that rely on [[npm]] packages to share platform dependencies across many repositories. These dependencies are sometimes referred to as 'horizontals', due to their scope.

The first deploy refers to updating the NPM package itself. e.g. adding a new navigation item to the header, which is then released as a new NPM version.

The second deploy refers to updating the apps using said NPM package, which need to be updated and deployed after the first deploy.

This second deploy is the difficult part, as deploys can get out of sync, create inconsistency, creates additional overhead, mess with existing priorities, and in general become a maintenance burden.
