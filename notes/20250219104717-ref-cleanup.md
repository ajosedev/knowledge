# Cleaning up refs

In React 19, `ref` now supports a cleanup function, similar to [[20220704105955-useeffect-cleanup-function]]. Previously, React would call `ref` functions with `null` when unmounting the component. If your `ref` returns a cleanup function, React will now skip this step.

In future versions, calling refs with `null` when unmounting components will be deprecated.

Due to the introduction of ref cleanup functions, returning anything else from a `ref` callback will now be rejected by TypeScript. The fix is usually to stop using implicit returns, for example:
```jsx
- <div ref={current => (instance = current)} />
+ <div ref={current => {instance = current}} />
```
