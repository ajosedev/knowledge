# Projects get dropped

Priorities shift. Business goals change. Resources fluctuate.

As a result, projects get dropped. Sometimes with a lot of notice, other times with none.

Keep that in mind when working on and planning projects. Make sure the project *can* be dropped at any time.

Keep documentation up to date. Keep estimates accurate. Plan iteratively, so you're still providing business value. See what you can release that's still useful.

When you drop something, wrap it in a bow so that you can come back to it later. Aim to always finish it in a good spot.
