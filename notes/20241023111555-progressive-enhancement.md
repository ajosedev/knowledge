# Progressive enhancement

>**Progressive enhancement** is a [[design]] philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code.

This way you're not restricting yourself from making the best experience just because not everyone can use it. This is very common in [[css]], where using a new selector like [[20210816101731-css-has]] doesn't have adequate browser support.

Similar to Graceful Degredation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Graceful_degradation, but in the opposite direction.
