# Design system documentation doesn't have to be boring

A documentation site can double-up as a marketing site too. You don't have to lead with dry technical documentation about components, APIs, etc. Instead, lead with something eye-catching. Show possible users what can be done with the design system. Show possible products, show flashy things.

Users of the design system are essentially clients. It's worth heeding the advice in other spaces about marketing to them, selling to them, etc.
