# Prioritisation using workarounds

If a problem has a workaround, you can lower the priority of fixing it.

A workaround unblocks the user - they don't have to wait until the problem is fixed upstream. Upstream may be a library you're maintaining, a project your pushing, a new dependency, etc.

As a maintainer, it lets you reduce your workload and prioritise things that don't have a workaround. Often the gold standard solution requires a lot more work, and may end up being an entirely different solution. A workaround stems the bleeding, and gets a useable result now.

Because of this, when it comes to [[designsystem]]s, it makes sense to build that really lower base. It enables workarounds for more complicated uses.
	Easy enough to build a simple tag or card if you don't have one
	Much harder to build a popover
