# The top layer

>The **top layer** is a specific layer that spans the entire width and height of the viewport and sits on top of all other layers displayed in a web document. It is created by the browser to contain elements that should appear on top of all other content on the page.

The primary use-case currently is the `dialog` element, with the `popover` element on its way.

Elements placed in the top layer generate a new [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context), as do their corresponding [`::backdrop`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::backdrop) pseudo-elements. Elements are stacked in the order they appear in the set (last one in is on top).

Note that z-index has no effect in the top layer, and you cannot position something on top of the top-layer using a high value.
