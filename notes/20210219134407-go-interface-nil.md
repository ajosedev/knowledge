# Nil in Go (interfaces)

An interface value is `nil` only if the `V` and `T` are both unset - `T=nil, V is not set`

Although an interface is `nil` by default, if we store a `nil` pointer (e.g. of type `*int`) as the value for an interface, the interface's type will be `*int` regardless of the underling value of the pointer. Thus, the interface itself will be `non-nil` even though the pointer's value is `nil`.

> An interface value that holds a nil concrete value is itself non-nil
> If the concrete value inside the interface itself is nil, the method will be called with a nil receiver.

```go
var p *int
var i DocsInterface
i = p // i is now T=*int,V=memory address, *i = nil
// i is non-nil
```

This also works when not talking about simple pointers, e.g. a `type`, pointer to a `struct`, etc. When the value is converted into an interface, the interface becomes `non-nil` as it's storing the type, even though the underlying value is `nil`. If the interface is used as an argument to a method, the interface datastructure is created when called, which uses the value of whatever is satisfying the interface.

### Example

In this case, `VError` implements the interface of `error`. When passing something of type `VError` to a function that had an `error` interface as an argument, the value passed will always be non-nil as the interface will be storing `T=VError`, even if `V` is nil.

```go
func (e Error) Error() {
    // implementation not important, but this satisfies the interface
}

type VError map[string]string // same is VError was a struct and verr was verr = *VError

func doSomethingWithAnError(e error) {
    // ...
}

var err error
var verr VError
err = verr

fmt.Printf("err: %T %#v \n", err, err) // main.VError main.VError(nil)
fmt.Printf("err2: %T %#v \n", err2, err2) // <nil> <nil>

fmt.Printf("verr == nil: %v \n", verr == nil) // true
fmt.Printf("err == nil: %v \n", err == nil) // false

doSomethingWithAnError(err) // this will pass a non-nil value
```
