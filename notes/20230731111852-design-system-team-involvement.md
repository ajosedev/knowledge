# Involving design system teams early

[[20220509012517-design-system-adoption|Adoption]] is often seen as the key goal and metric for a [[designsystem]]. However, it's often a lagging metric, which makes it easier to track but harder to change. Additionally, it's not a silver bullet that enables proper design usage, nor UI consistency.

Usually a better indicator is how early the design system team is involved in the [[design]] or [[product]] process. The earlier this happens, the more helpful the design system team, and the design system itself can be. Rather than being a tool that simply supplies components, it's embedded as a process and tool to work faster. [[20220509045044-design-system-why]]

The earlier, the better.
