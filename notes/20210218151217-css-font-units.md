# CSS units

Different CSS units have different uses - there's no great one size fits all. Using `px` for everything brings about [[a11y]] issues. Using `rem` for everything is usually confusing, and can sometimes have a negative impact on a11y too.

### Font-size related units

`em` - font size of the parent element
`rem` font size of the root element

`em` is a good candidate for anything that's related to the size of your type, e.g. padding for text boxes, margin for headings, etc. That way, when the font-size of the text grows, the padding/spacing between components grows also. However, it compounds as `font-size` is inherited.
`rem` is good for setting your font-size itself, see [[20220523113342-font-scaling-a11y]] for more details.

### Character units

Both `ch` and `ex` pertain to the (approximate) width and height of one character respectively.

`ch` is equal to the **width** of a `0`
`ex` is equal to the **height** of a `x`
`lh` is equal to the computed value of the line-height, which can be great for sizing icons. [[20240819050402-icon-size-lh]]

`ch` is helpful for restricting max-widths for readability. [[20210201144247-line-length]]

Most of these also have a r-prefixed version which is based on the root element's font, similar to `em` and `rem`.
