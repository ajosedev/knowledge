# `Array<T>` vs `T[]`

These two syntaxes are very similar, and are almost functionally identical in [[ts]]. The only real difference is the use of [[20210331123346-keyof-typescript]] operator. 

```ts
type Person = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
};
 
const result: keyof Person[] = ["id", "name"];
// Type 'string[]' is not assignable to type 'keyof Person[]'.
```

The `[]` operator occurs before the `keyof` operator. Meaning it evaluates as `keyof Person[]`, not `('id' | 'name')[]`. You can fix this with parenthesis, or using the generic syntax.

```ts
const result: (keyof Person)[] = ["id", "name"];
const result: Array<keyof Person> = ["id", "name"];
```

They're so similar in fact, https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/array-type/ lets you pick one or the other for its rule.
