# Encore at Spotify

> It’s a framework that brings Spotify’s existing design systems under one brand—a “system of systems.”

First layer:
**Encore Foundation** is design tokens, motion, guidelines, spacing, etc. Everything uses this.

Second layer:
**Encore Web** is everything for typical web design systems. Buttons, dialogs, forms, etc. Anything built from web tech, including the desktop client.
**Encore Mobile** like web, but for native mobile.

Third layer:
Encore also has 'local design systems'. A layer to keep design elements that are tailored for specific products or audiences. Shared, but not shared across everything.

Each layer builds on the previous, and provides assets, code, documentation, etc. Each is also actively maintained by a dedicated team to avoid bottlenecks from a single, central DS.
