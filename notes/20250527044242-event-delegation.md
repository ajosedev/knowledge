# Event Delegation

[[20210920150655-js-events]] helps us understand 'event delegation' - a technique in which the parent element is responsible for event handling, rather than many children elements. This is particular helpful when there are many child elements, or the elements are dynamic.

Fewer event listeners also leads to better performance, and simpler code.
