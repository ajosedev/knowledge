# The selectmenu element

`<selectmenu>` is a new experimental form element that takes the place of `<select>`, with a goal of being a lot more customisable.

The default markup is very similar to a regular `<select>`:
```html
<selectmenu>
  <option>Option 1</option>
  <option>Option 2</option>
  <option>Option 3</option>
</selectmenu>
```

However, more parts are targetable with [[css]], and even the markup is more customisable. A custom `button` can be introduced to control the open/closed state.
