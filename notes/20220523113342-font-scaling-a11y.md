# Font scaling and font size units

Although browser zoom works well when defining font sizes in `px`, it won't scale typography when using global font size adjustments in the browser (or 'font scaling').

Setting type in relative units such as `rem` or `em` works with both of these.

A general rule is:
> “Should this value scale up as the user increases their browser's default font size?”

If yes, `rem`. Otherwise, `px`.
