# Font scaling and font size units

Although browser zoom works well when defining font sizes in `px`, it won't scale typography when using global font size adjustments in the browser (or 'font scaling'). And yes, people do change this setting.

Setting type in relative units such as `rem` or `em` works with both of these.

Crucially, this means that you can't use a non-relative unit anywhere in the tree. If you set a `px` value on the `html`, the use of `rem` has now become meaningless. You'll always reference that root, not the user's setting.

As a sidenote, the default value of browsers isn't always 16px. https://nicolas-hoizey.com/articles/2016/03/02/people-don-t-change-the-default-16px-font-size-in-their-browser

A general rule is:
> “Should this value scale up as the user increases their browser's default font size?”

If yes, `rem`. Otherwise, `px`.
In practice that usually means `rem` for at least text size.

Using rem for something like `padding` can actually make things worse - as the font scales and [[20210201144247-line-length]] becomes shorter as a result, padding will get larger, compounding the issue.

`em` can be useful for things _related_ to text. e.g. vertical rhythm ([[20200314213706-flow-containers]]), margin on headings, text containers, etc.
