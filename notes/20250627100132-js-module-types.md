# JS Modules

There are two main module types in Javascript/Node:
- CommonJS (CJS)
- ECMAScript Modules (ES Modules, ESM)

## CommonJS
Uses the `require('./file.js')` syntax for importing other modules and the `module.exports =` syntax for exporting stuff from modules
CommonJS files can use the `.cjs` extension to tell Node that they are in CommonJS (or `.cts`)
CommonJS imports are _synchronous_
CommonJS works in Node but does **not** work in browsers

```js
const { foo } = require('bar')

module.exports = function defaultCjsExport() {};

module.exports.namedCjsExport = function namedCjsExport() {};
```

## ES Modules
Uses the `import {stuff} from './file.js'` syntax for importing and the `export stuff` syntax for exports
ESM files can use the `.mjs` extension to tell Node that they are in ESM (or `.mts`)
ESM imports are _asynchronous_ (which also allows for [top-level `await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await#top_level_await))
ESM is supported by all modern browsers and the latest versions of Node, but does **not** work at all in Node versions below 12

```js
import { foo } from 'bar'

export function namedMjsExport() {}

export default function defaultMjsExport() {}
```

Due to ESM being more modern, much of JavaScript tooling was developed for Node in CJS. ESM can `import` from CJS, but has issues around named imports in particular. Note that the reverse does not work.

A key example is Jest, which only (or at least used to) works with CJS. This is a major reason for Vitest becoming more popular, as it have native ESM support.
