# Keyboard navigation in MacOS

For whatever reason, the default on MacOS is to not allow a proper tab order for websites in Safari (and Firefox). This doesn't seem to affect Chrome.

Without this setting enabled (by default), the tab order won't be the expected tab order for a page - many things will be skipped.
