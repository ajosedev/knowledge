# Microsites

Similar to [[20220628012817-microfrontends]], 'microsites' doesn't have a concrete definition.

The closest definition I can think of is that microsites are several linked applications. Usually each application is its own [[20221128105028-spa-mpa|SPA]]. This creates a 'seam' between different parts of your overall application in which you have vertical slices.
