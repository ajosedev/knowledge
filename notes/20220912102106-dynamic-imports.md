# Dynamic imports

Instead of statically importing code, dynamic imports allow you to impart parts of your code on demand. This way everything isn't added to a single bundle.

This exists in vanilla [[js]] through the `import()` expression, which returns a promise. https://javascript.info/modules-dynamic-imports
```js
import(modulePath).then(obj => obj);
```

This can be achieved in other ways depending on your tooling. [[nextjs]] has a custom way, there's also [[reactsuspense]], etc.

Dynamic imports can be used as an indicator for your bundler to apply [[20220911060950-code-splitting|code splitting]].
