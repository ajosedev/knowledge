# :focus-within

>The **`:focus-within`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) matches an element if the element or any of its descendants are focused. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus) pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by `:focus`. (This includes descendants in [shadow trees](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).)

Since CSS has difficulty targeting a 'parent element', this can be a useful tool for styling the parent of a focusable element.
