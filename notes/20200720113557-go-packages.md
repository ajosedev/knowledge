# Packages in Go

Packages are a level above functions in Go.
The `main` package represents an executable, and any other package is known as a _library package_, which can not have a _main_ function. These library packages help split up code into more manageable pieces.

Packages can span multiple files, and the file names do not matter.

Declare the package with `package <name>`.
Import with `import <optional alias> <package name>`

If a package requires initialisation, the _init_ function can be used.
