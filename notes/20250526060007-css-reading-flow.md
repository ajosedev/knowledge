# reading-flow and reading-order

Before using these, consider the rules around ordering documents: [[20221221034242-DOM-order-vs-visual-order]]

These two properties are similar to `order`, but also affect the focus order. Both of these are a much better solution than using `tabindex` which is calculated at a page level, and has a myriad of other [[a11y]] issues.

## `reading-flow`

The `reading-flow` CSS property controls the order that elements in a flex, grid, or block layout are exposed to accessibility tools and how they get focused using linear sequential navigation methods.

It takes one keyword value, with a default of `normal`, which keeps the behavior of ordering elements in DOM order. To use it inside a flex container, set its value to either `flex-visual` or `flex-flow`. To use it inside a grid container, set its value to either `grid-rows`, `grid-columns`, or `grid-order`.

## `reading-order`

The `reading-order` CSS property lets you manually override the order of items within a reading flow container. To use this property inside a grid, flex, or block container, set the `reading-flow` value on the container to `source-order` and set the individual item's `reading-order` to an integer value.
