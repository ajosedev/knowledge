# Stewarding design system contributions

As mentioned [[20230116034042-design-system-contributions]], facilitating contributions can be very difficult. A key aspect of improving this is by having a guide for external contributions - a steward.

A couple tips for successfully stewarding contributions:

Start with a conversation. It's the easiest way to draw more info, lower the barrier to entry, and empower the contributor. Docs can often be intimidating, so just talk to people.

Talk only about the next step. Going back to intimidation, the contributor doesn't need to know the minutiae of a contribution - at least, not yet. Especially considering they may not be responsible for every step. Teach them what they need to know, when they need to know it.

Ask what they can do. Gauge their enthusiasm and knowledge for certain tasks. Be comfortable helping them more in different aspects, and even doing some of the work yourself.

Check in regularly. Contributions stall and get blocked, but make sure you're not the reason for it.

If they can't do all the work, do it yourself. Balance the contributor and the steward doing work, depending on resources and knowledge. Ideally, anticipate these gaps and plan for them.

Balance completing the contribution and increasing their knowledge of the system. You want contributors to come back.
