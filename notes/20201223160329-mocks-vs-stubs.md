# Mocks vs Stubs vs Fakes

**Stubs** deal with state verification, **mocks** deal with behaviour interaction.

Stubs have _predetermined_ behaviour used for testing - set methods with set responses, further away from the test. Stubs are more reusable, arguably the work put in to create them is saved later when using them.
Stub: setup -> exercise -> verify state -> teardown

Mocks are setup with expectations, and are usually closer to the test. This means they don't have predetermined behaviour.
Mocks can be considered a type of stub, that register calls they recieve and then you can check if your test called them correctly.
Mock: setup data -> setup expectations -> exercise -> verify expectations (verify correct methods have been involved) -> verify state -> teardown

Both help you assert on _what_ happened, but only mocks deal with _how_ its happened.

**Fakes** is also a term sometimes used in this area. Fakes have working implementations, but their implementation differs to production. Usually a simplified version or something that takes a shortcut, such as using a hashmap for data, rather than a DB. Fakes have a closer to real-world implementation than a stub however - stubs contain hard-coded responses to expected requests, fakes just take a small shortcut over the production implementation.

That being said, depending on who you ask, you may get a different answer.
