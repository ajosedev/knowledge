# Clip paths in CSS

>The **`clip-path`** [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.

It mostly takes one `<basic-shape>` value, which can be one:
- one of multiple shapes, e.g. `circle`, `rect`, `ellipse`
- `polygon` which uses a SVG filling rule and a set of vertices
- `path` which uses a SVG path definition
- `shape` which uses shape commands for lines, curves, and arcs

`shape` is a bit more robust than `path` as it allows percentage values and CSS units, which ultimately leads to a more responsive clip path.

You can also use a SVG as a clip path source with `url`.

Note that the old keyword used to be `clip`, but that's now deprecated.
