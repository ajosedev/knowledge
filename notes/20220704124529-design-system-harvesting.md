# Harvesting existing design system patterns

When starting a design system team for an *existing product*, its tempting to want to **create** foundations and best practices for your organisation. This often leads to an unsuccessful team and low adoption.

Instead, **collect** foundations and best practices to start your design system.

A step-by-step way to collect these foundations:
1.  Collect what’s being practiced.
2.  Within that, look for what’s **common**.
3.  Within that, look for what’s **good**.

Identifying these factors are key in increasing the likelihood of adoption.

I personally refer to this process as 'harvesting'. Look to harvest components rather than create new foundations:
1. Multiple feature teams have similar components
2. Design system team creates an abstracted version of said component
3. Feature teams re-adopt the abstracted component
4. New teams use the abstracted component

It's important to wait until multiple variations of these components exist. You don't want to create the [[20221026123121-the-wrong-abstraction]]. [[20220704125636-design-system-requests-identify-needs]] mentions this, as different teams may create subtly different components that then need to be centralised [[20211115112656-rule-of-three]]

[[20220704125509-design-systems-snowflakes]] also fall into a similar category. Once a snowflake becomes common, it makes sense to adopt it into your design system. Recipes as mentioned in [[20211122112956-design-system-component-hierarchy]] can become a great incubation layer to identify what's needed.
