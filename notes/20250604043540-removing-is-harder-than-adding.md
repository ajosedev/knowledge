# Removing something is infinitely harder than adding something

Be caution when adding things to a system or platform - removing something is infinitely harder than adding something.
Often once something is added, you're responsible for a migration path away from your supported solution, even if the amount of users is low.
Additionally, there's often technical complexity. That part of your system may be tangled in other parts, necessitating rewrites or difficult removal.

Furthering that, every time you add something, it's something to maintain. There's an initial cost, and an going cost.
