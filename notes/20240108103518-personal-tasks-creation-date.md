# Tracking the creation date of personal tasks

Often your personal backlog is full of items you realistically will never get to. A useful way of tracking these items is by tracking the creation date of tasks. If something keeps getting pushed back for more important things, it's a good opportunity to remove yourself from that task entirely. Either by delegating it, or removing it altogether.

Another way that can be helpful is to plan your tasks at the week-level (i.e. weekly), not the day-level. This avoids recency bias and can feel a little less overwhelming. Still feel free to adjust daily though.
