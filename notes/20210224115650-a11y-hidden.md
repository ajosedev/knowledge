# Hiding things accessibly

Hidden for everyone: `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`

Hidden visually, but present for assistive tech? A `.visually-hidden` class with a smattering of properties to do the job correctly.

Hidden for assistive tech, but not visually? The `aria-hidden="true"` attribute/value.

```css
.visually-hidden {
  clip: rect(0 0 0 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

If the element that uses `.visually-hidden` is focusable, they should become visible upon receiving focus - otherwise a sighted user will lose their focus somewhere off screen.

```css
.visually-hidden:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  /* ... */
}
```
