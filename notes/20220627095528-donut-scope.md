# Donut scope

Donut scope is all about picking where a scope starts and ends. We want to apply styling to a certain area (the 'donut'), while allowing content inside of that area to be unstyled (the 'donut hole'). The 'donut hole' is where user-created content lives, whether that be:
- content passed the component
- 3rd party embeds (+ styling)
- user-generated copy
- etc

Think of a Tabs component, where the individual Tab buttons and Tab Panels require styling, but content within should be unopinionated.

This helps work against the cascade - you're basically asking for a certain range to cascade in, but stop before the internal slot.

This is achievable with the [[20211115082404-css-not-selector]] in some forms:
- `foo :not(.foo .foo *)` to match things inside one .foo wrapper but not two
- `.container :not(.content *)` to get simple shallow donut scope

The latter of these two doesn't seem to work without passing two selectors: `.content, .content *`. Unsure why, but the behaviour of `:not` is a bit more confusing when no element is passed before the `:not`.

`article p:not(blockquote *)` would match all `p` elements inside of an `article`, but not descendents of a `blockquote`.
