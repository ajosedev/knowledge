# useEffectEvent - separating effects from reactive values

This is an experimental API, but helps with one of the big problems with [[20220815044638-useeffect]], separating reactive and non-reactive logic.

Props, state, and variables declared inside your component’s body are called **reactive values**. Reactive values can change due to a re-render. Logic inside effects is reactive.
Logic inside event handlers is not reactive. It does not run automatically. Event handlers can read reactive values without “reacting” to their changes.

```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    // ...
```

As both `roomId` and `theme` are reactive, both should be in the deps array.
```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      showNotification('Connected!', theme);
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => {
      connection.disconnect()
    };
  }, [roomId, theme]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

However, You don't want this to execute based on the `theme` changing, only if the `roomId` does. The above code has an issue - if the theme changes, it will re-connect to the room.

**You need a way to separate this non-reactive logic from the reactive Effect around it.**

React has some suggestions on how to solve this problem (https://react.dev/learn/removing-effect-dependencies#removing-unnecessary-dependencies). Which are loosely:
- Consider if your effects should actually be an event handler
- Use [[20220704020508-usestate-function]] to get current state
- Keep effects as lean as possible
- Otherwise...

This is where `useEffectEvent` comes in. It's currently still experimental, but in the above example, it would allow you to separate the non-reactive logic out:
```js
function ChatRoom({ roomId, theme }) {
  const onConnected = useEffectEvent(() => {
    showNotification('Connected!', theme);
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    const connection = createConnection(serverUrl, roomId);
    connection.on('connected', () => {
      onConnected();
    });
    connection.connect();
    return () => connection.disconnect();
  }, [roomId]); // ✅ All dependencies declared
  // ...
```

React docs mentions the following:
>After `useEffectEvent` becomes a stable part of React, we recommend **never suppressing the linter**.
