# Platforms are a reflection of values

Values are important to any platform. Everyone wants their platform to be concerned around: composability, debuggability, maintainability, operability, ...

Unfortunately, you can't get them all. It's important to think about what values you care about most. You need **core values**.

Ideally, these should be documented and nurtured. Otherwise, implicit values that individuals have will come into conflict. Having clear values does the opposite - helps find a solution when there are competing options.
