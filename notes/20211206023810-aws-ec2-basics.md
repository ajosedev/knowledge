# AWS EC2 Basics

Elastic Compute Cloud.

Secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. A VM, but hosted by AWS.
Designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Managed by you, you have complete control - grow and shrink as needed.

A game changer when first released, as you no longer had to manage on-prem hardware that needed to plan for future scaling. Pay only what you use.

Pricing tiers:
On-demand - pay by the hour/second. Flexible, useful for short-term and testing the water.

Reserved - reserved capacity for 1-3 years, with a big discount. Good for predictable usage where you can afford to pay up front. Can scale your reserved instances on a schedule. Operate at a regional level.

Spot - purchase unused capacity at a discount, prices fluctuate with supply and demand. You dictate the price and gain spot instances when that instances at the price is available. Good for apps with flexible start/end times, and those with an urgent need for large amount of additional computing capacity.
