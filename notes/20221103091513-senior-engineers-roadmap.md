# Senior engineers and roadmaps

Don't be constrained by a roadmap as a senior engineer. Try to find the time to work hard on things that aren't explicitly on your team's roadmap. This is a great way to win favour, and increase the scope of your influence.

Everyone loves an engineer that solves their annoying problems. Senior engineers are aware of the problems plaguing the organisation, pick the most important one, and fix it.
