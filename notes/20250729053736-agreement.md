# The importance of agreement

"Remember when we agreed that" is a great phrase to resurface accountability. Once you've agreed on something, you can revisit that agreement in the future when memories fade, or priorities shift.

It's a good tool to avoid things like [[20230411101852-scope-creep]].

Remember though before you can use this phrase you have to agree, which is difficult in its own right. When do reach agreement, document it. Slack is okay, documents are better.
