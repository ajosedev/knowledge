# What is Isomorphic?

In the context of Javascript, React, etc.

Simply put, isomorphic refers to something that runs on both the server and in the browser (the client).

Most often used in the context of web apps, where the code can execute on the server through things like SSR/SSG, or through the browser when SSR/SSG is not available.

Some refer to it as 'Universal Javascript' also.
