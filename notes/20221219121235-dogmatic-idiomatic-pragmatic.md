# Dogmatic, idiomatic, and pragmatic

## Dogmatic
>Dogma is _a belief or set of beliefs that is accepted by the members of a group without being questioned or doubted_

Dogmatic extends that, meaning:
>inclined to lay down principles (dogma) as undeniably true.

Generally, don't be dogmatic. It's better to be pragmatic.

## Idiomatic
Idiomatic refers to following the conventions of a given language. The way to loop over a collection is different in [[js]] to [[go]].
By writing idiomatic code, it should help enable consistency and understanding for others who are also writing in that language.

## Pragmatic
>dealing with things sensibly and realistically in a way that is based on practical rather than theoretical considerations.

Separate baseless opinions and preferences in favour of what's more objectively best.
