# HTML Content Categories

HTML elements are a member of one or more content categories. These categories group elements with common characteristics. Categories have a lot of overlap, and there's subset categories also.

Each category dictates acceptable descendants. e.g. `p` can only contain phrasing content, but `div` can contain flow content

- Metadata content: metadata - head, title, link, etc
- Flow content: a broad category that contains many other categories
	- Sectioning content: creates sections - article, aside, nav
	- Heading content: defines the title of a section - h1-h6
	- Phrasing content: text and markup
	- Embedded content: imports another resource
	- Interactive content: things designed for user interaction
	- Form-associated content

There's a few more, but these are the most common, but these are the 'main' ones

MDN often puts this in the technical summary as 'Content categories' and 'Permitted content'
