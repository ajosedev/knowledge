# Ambient in Typescript

In [[ts]], 'ambient' is anything that doesn't have an implementation. That is, it's a declaration only. They have no run-time impact. Typically, these are defined in `d.ts` files [[20221216123530-ts-declaration-files]]

There are different types of ambient things, e.g:
- ambient variable declaration: `declare var $: any`
- ambient class declaration: `declare class C { foo(); }`
- ambient module: a .d.ts file with a top level import export
- ambient module declaration: `declare module "foo" { .. }`

All type-only declarations like `interface` or `type` are inherently ambient.

```
Anything that does not have an implementation, e.g.:

    ambient variable declaration => declare var $: any
    ambient class declaration => declare class C { foo(); } , etc..

A module can be ambient as well; so

    "ambient module" is a .d.ts file with a top level import or export.
    "ambient module declaration" is something of the form declare module "foo" { .. }
