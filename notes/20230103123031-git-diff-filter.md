# diff-filter in Git

The `--diff-filter` argument can be applied to multiple [[git]] commands to select files that match a specific state.

`A` - Added
`D` - Deleted
`M` - Modified
`R` - Renamed
etc

This is helpful for commands like `git log` and `git diff`.

e.g. `git log --diff-filter D` shows you all commits that have ever deleted files
e.g. `git diff master --diff-filter A` shows you what files have been added in the diff between the two branches
