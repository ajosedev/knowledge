# The 'loop closure bug'

The loop closure bug is when creating an array of functions inside of a loop that references `i`, the end result for all the functions is the same value of `i`.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs[i] = function() {
    console.log("My value: " + i);
  };
}

// outputs:
// My value: 3
// My value: 3
// My value: 3
```

One possible solution is to use `let` instead. By using `let` instead, a new `i` variable exists on each iteration, so the code works as expected. Using `var` means that `i` is bound to the same variable outside of the loop. Each function would print `3` as `i` exists outside of the scope of the loop, and is not 'captured' at any point of time. This also means setting `i` after this loop and before calling `funcs` would also change the output.

Another solution is to create a closure that creates functions. This function will make its own local copy of the variable. (TODO)
```js
function createFunc(i) {
  return function() {
    console.log("My value: " + i);
  };
}

for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  funcs[i] = createFunc(i);
}
```
