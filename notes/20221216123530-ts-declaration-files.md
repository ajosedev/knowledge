# Declaration files in Typescript

>`.d.ts` files are _declaration_ files that contain _only_ type information. These files donâ€™t produce `.js` outputs; they are only used for typechecking.

These are useful for describing libraries that are not written in [[ts]], e.g. [[js]]-only libraries.

If you're working within a Typescript project, you probably shouldn't be using them. If you need to separate types, keep them in a `.ts` file, not a `.d.ts` file for a myriad of reasons. Namely, they can't contain runtime functionality, and put everything in the global scope. They are not modules.

Declaration files are usually bundled with packages. Packages are built into `.js` files, with a separate co-located `d.ts` file. Otherwise, `@types` packages from `DefinitelyTyped` are useful. These are community created packages that describe popular libraries.

If the types don't exist at all, [[20221215045252-ts-ambient]] can be used to create types for the third party library.

TypeScript automatically finds type definitions under `node_modules/@types`. Meaning if the library is set up correctly, the consumer doesn't have to do anything special. This is controlled by the `typeRoots` option in TSConfig.
There's also the `types` option, which does similar. `typeRoots` is for folders, `types` is for exact types.

If you specify either `typeRoots` to `types`, it **removes** the default behaviour of finding all `@types`. Thus setting these options requires you to be all encompassing.
e.g:
```json
  "compilerOptions": {
    "types": ["node", "jest", "express"]
  }
```

>This `tsconfig.json` file will _only_ include `./node_modules/@types/node`, `./node_modules/@types/jest` and `./node_modules/@types/express`. Other packages under `node_modules/@types/*` will not be included.
