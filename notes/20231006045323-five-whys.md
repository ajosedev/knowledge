# Five whys (5 whys)

>Five whys (or 5 whys) is an iterative interrogative technique used to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem. The primary goal of the technique is to determine the root cause of a defect or problem by repeating the question "Why?" five times. The answer to the fifth why should reveal the root cause of the problem.

I find this incredibly valuable, not necessarily the "five whys" but just always questioning everything and asking "why?"
