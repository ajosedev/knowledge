# Whitespace + Flex

The following doesn't retain its spacing between the anchor link and the span.
This only happens with flex, as the children (whitespace?) become block elements.

```html
<div className="flex">
  <span>For extra assistance, please </span>
  <a href="#">contact support</a>
</div>
```

To fix this, use `white-space: pre` or `pre-wrap`.
