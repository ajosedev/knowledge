#todo

- when presenting information, present it as abstracted as you can while still getting the point across
- 'hide the implementation'
- progressively disclose information as needed
- effectively don't get bogged down in the details
- focus on the requirements, not the exact specification
- e.g. for token systems, talk about the system, not the values
- try to stretch it in both depth and breadth
- need to do both internally, but don't need to show all your work
	- often need to alternate between the two as well
- engineering adage: see what you can take away, not what you can add
- this might just be my mental model, not everyone's
	- but in theory helps focus people on the thing you want, not the minutuae/unrelated stuff
- ultimately you should still tailor for your audience
