# Feature flags

These allow you to modify system behaviour without changing code.

This in turn allows you to decouple deploys from releases. Decoupling brings about other positives, such as smaller pull requests, less rebasing, less blocking, CI/CD, etc.

By having a toggle-able control flow, it unlocks extra benefits such as A/B testing, canary deploys, testing in production, QA, etc.

Also known as 'feature toggles'.
