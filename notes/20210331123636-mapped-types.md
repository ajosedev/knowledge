# Mapped types

Mapped types help build types that are based off another type. A mapped type is a generic type which uses `in keyof` to iterate through the keys of one type to create another.

They build off of [[20230403122631-index-signature-ts]].

In the following snippet, `in keyof` uses `keyof` to generate a union of all keys in `Type`. These are then assigned as properties (e.g. keys in a key/value pair) inside of `OptionsFlags`.

```typescript
type OptionsFlags<Type> = {
  [Property in keyof Type]: boolean;
};

type FeatureFlags = {
  darkMode: () => void;
  newUserProfile: () => void;
};

type FeatureOptions = OptionsFlags<FeatureFlags>;
//   ^ = type FeatureOptions = {
//       darkMode: boolean;
//       newUserProfile: boolean;
//   }
```
