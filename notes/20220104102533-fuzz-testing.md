# Fuzzing

Fuzz testing, or Fuzzing is a type of automated software testing that aims to find bugs by providing malformed, random, unexpected, or invalid data. This data aims to cause errors, find bugs, or crash the program, which is monitored by the fuzz test.

Since fuzzing can reach edge cases which humans often miss, it can be particularly valuable for finding security exploits and vulernabilities.
