# Loaders in Webpack

Loaders in [[webpack]] can be a little confusing, due to how they work in order. Here's a few important rules to remember:
1. Loaders are processed in reverse order, i.e. bottom to top
2. They take the current source and return a new source
3. Multiple loaders can be applied to a single resource, i.e. chained.

From the docs (https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/)
>Loaders can be chained. Each loader in the chain applies transformations to the processed resource. A chain is executed in reverse order. The first loader passes its result (resource with applied transformations) to the next one, and so forth. Finally, webpack expects JavaScript to be returned by the last loader in the chain.

This means these two snippets are functionally identical:
```js
{
    test: /\.css$/,
    loaders: ['style'],
},
{
    test: /\.css$/,
    loaders: ['css'],
},
```

```js
{
    test: /\.css$/,
    loaders: ['style', 'css'],
},
```
For this one, remember that it's equivalent to `style(css(file))`, meaning `css(file)` is evaluated first.

Asset Modules also exists in this area. It's a new feature in Webpack 5 that allows you to use asset files without having to configure a bunch of loaders for it, e.g. `raw-loader`, `url-loader`, `file-loader`, etc. https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/
