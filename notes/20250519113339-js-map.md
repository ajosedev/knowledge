# Map vs Object in JS

A `Map` is similar to an `Object`, but has a few differences:
- Preserves insertion order of keys
- Has better performance for frequent additions/removals/lookups (e.g. `.set`)
- Does not have native support for serialising or parsing (i.e. works less well with JSON)
- Easier to get the size, using `.size`
- Does not contain any keys by default, unlike `Object` which has a `prototype`
