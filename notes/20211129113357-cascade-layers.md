# Cascade layers

Layers are a new functionality in CSS that allows more control of the cascade and specificity of selectors. When using them, a 'stronger' layer will beat a stronger selector in a 'weaker' layer. [[20220801045127-css-specificity]] is only relevant inside a layer.

You can define as many layers as you want, such as a `reset`, `base`, `theme`, etc. This really helps you control how weak certain parts of your styling is, which is great for managing external libraries vs resets vs overrides etc.

As of right now, this still doesn't really have browser support and unlayered styles are the strongest styles.
