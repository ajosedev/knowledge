# NPM script order
Running `npm install` executes multiple scripts defined by the package you are installing (i.e. in _their_ package.json). This is how npm modules such as Cypress install binaries and other setup steps.

The following are run when you run `npm install`:
    preinstall
    install
    postinstall
    prepublish
    preprepare
    prepare
    postprepare
