# Marks in Vim

Marks denote a specific position in a buffer. They can be set with `m<mark>` and jumped to with various means, usually `\<mark>`.

-   `a-z` - local buffer marks
-   `A-Z` - global buffer marks

## Moving to marks
-   `'<mark>` - Move to the _first non-blank character_ of the line where the mark `<mark>` was set.
-   `` ` `` - Move to the _exact position_ where the mark `<mark>` was set.
-   `g' <mark>` ``g` <mark>`` - Move to the mark `<mark>` without changing the jump list

## Special marks
-   `m<` or `m>` - Set the marks `'<` and `'>`.
-   `` `[ `` - Move to the first character of the previously changed, deleted, or yanked content.
-   `` `] `` - Move to the last character of the previously changed, deleted, or yanked content.
-   ` `` ` - Move to the position before the latest jump from the jump list
-   `` `" `` - Move to the position were you’ve closed the current file for the last time.
-   `` `^ `` - Move to the position where you’ve used INSERT mode for the last time
