# Dotenv

After using `dotenv` (or `dotenvx`) for a while, I'm still not the best way on how to use it.

`.env.example` seems like a sane approach for providing keys that need to be filled in with secrets, usually in an `.env`. Alternative secrets are stored in `.env.local` if `.env` is the example file. Either way this keeps secrets out of Git.

Where it gets a bit more confusing is sharing environment variables across environments that aren't secret. e.g. Database IDs. Is it okay to put them into something like `.env.development` and `.env.production` and commit those?

I don't believe `.env.production` with orthogonal environment variables breaks any 12factor config rules. It's just a config file essentially, as long as it doesn't have secrets. This does make it infinitely easier to create a production-like environment on a local machine.

**Regardless, secrets should be kept out of anything in Git.** Load them through something like GitHub CI variables directly.
