# Tree shaking

Tree shaking is a form of [[20220912113924-dead-code-elimination|dead code elimination]]. It removes unreachable code ('dead code') from a bundle.

This reduces the size of the final bundle, while requiring minimal work from the developer.

Note that statements like `import * as x from dependency` removes a bundler's ability to tree shake, as it imports everything from the dependency, and can't tell what is unused.

Only ESM packages can be tree shaken.

The `sideEffects` property in package.json can have a large effect on the performance of tree shaking.
