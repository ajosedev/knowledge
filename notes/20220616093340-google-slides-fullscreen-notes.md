# Presenting with Google Slides

To present fullscreen slides with speaker notes, it's a little annoying. This is referring to Firefox, and might be different in Chrome.

1. Slideshow dropdown -> presenter view
2. If the notes window is smaller due to Retina scaling, the window back and forth from external monitor
3. Hover over the bottom left of the presentation -> enter fullscreen
