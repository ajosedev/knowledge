# A reason against Atomic Design

[[20211129114322-atomic-design-primer|Atomic Design]] is well and truly mainstream at this stage. However it still has its faults - namely the categorisation behind each level.

The general principle still works, smaller elements build up in various ways to make larger parts. However, the 5 categories it offers often have blurred lines which detracts from its original goal.

For example, is a combobox a molecule or an organism? It's not a distinct section of an interface, so calling it an organism is hard. However it is still a combination of two molecules.

If the name doesn't properly identify an area, feel free to create a different category name to better communicate the idea. Use the Atomic Design principles rather than the exact naming convention.
