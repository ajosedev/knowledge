# Being a catalyst for change

If you know what needs doing and how to do it, it's sometimes easier to start before asking for permission. Asking for permission can get you in a mess of delays, red tape, etc.

Instead, follow the 'stone soup' story. Start on anything you can, and ask for what you can reasonably ask for. Then, incrementally ask for more. It's easier to join an ongoing success than a theoretical idea.
