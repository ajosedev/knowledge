Here's a [great article](https://bigmedium.com/ideas/design-system-ecosystem.html) around the different layers of the design system. One that I really agree with is the 'recipe layer'.
>which contains composed UI components to be used consistently across specific contexts (like a product or product family), but arenâ€™t reusable across the entire organization.

Anecdotally we did something similar at 99designs, and it worked really well. Essentially they are just smaller UI component libraries that built off the core design system. It's almost like an incubator.

This works really well at allowing you to slow down and only bring in versatile, proven, and useful components into the design system [[20231027111000-design-system-speed]]. Until then, teams still have all the benefits of sharing code, and the DS team isn't a bottleneck.
