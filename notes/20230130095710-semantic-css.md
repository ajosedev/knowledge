# Semantic CSS

Semantic [[css]] is considered the 'default', as well as *usually* the best practice. It involves giving classes semantic names, i.e. naming it by its purpose.
A class like `.page-heading` is semantic.

Methodologies like [[20220822111358-bem]] are built on top of this.

[[20230126095251-utility-first-css]] is an alternative approach.
