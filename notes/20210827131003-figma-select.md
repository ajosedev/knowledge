# Selecting items in Figma

By default, Figma will select layers, which can be a bit annoying when diving deep into componentry. Some helpful shortcuts:
- CMD + Click - 'Deep Select', to directly select a nested child layer
- CMD + Right Click - Quick access to the 'Select Layer' dropdown menu

	Additionally there are keyboard shortcuts for moving between layers:
- Enter - select child
- Shift + Enter - select parent
- Tab - select next sibling
- Shift + Tab - select previous sibling
