# Limiting lines of code written

As I become more senior, more of my job becomes around planning, managing scope, maintenance, balancing priorities, etc.

As such, my personal priorities shift towards reducing the amount of work ongoing for myself and my team, at any one point. Jokingly, the goal is to 'do as little work as possible' (while of course, still hitting your goals).

Large parts of this are helping manage things like [[20230411101852-scope-creep]], or generally considering maintenance cost [[20250514103019-owning-a-platform]].

Another way to think of this is to **limit the amount of lines of code written**. Question every decision, re-check requirements, ignore ridiculous edge cases that won't happen, etc.

From a pure engineering side too, it's good to keep your solutions as small as possible.
