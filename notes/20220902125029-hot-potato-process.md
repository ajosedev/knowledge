# The Hot Potato process

A big misconception between designers and developers is that 'handoff' is a one-time, one-direction event. A designer hand off their files to a developer, and the process is complete.

This isn't the reality. Questions arise at later times, timelines shift, resources change, certain things aren't feasible, etc.

Instead, ideas should be passed back and forth between the two disciplines, communicating and collaborating often. This leverages the knowledge that each discipline has, while making sure the project doesn't get stuck.

The best way to use the process is to sit together. Whether that be physically, remote over tools like Zoom, or through recordings to deal with time zones. Constant communication is the key.
