# True but useless

'True but useless' (TBU) is an acronym that is somewhat self explanatory. It's purpose is to identify what is TBU, so that you can immediately put it to the side, and instead focus on things that are useful.

Don't get bogged down talking about things that are TBU - they distract from what you need to be focusing on.
