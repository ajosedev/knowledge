# Tech debt is a resource (or tool)

Tech debt can be used as a resource to accelerate projects when required.

If you need to build a feature extremely quickly, you can build explicitly only that feature. This will cost you time in the long run, if you need to add to the feature, or maintain it, or got something wrong. For a while you may need engineers to perform simple tasks since a user can't do it. That's okay though.

Essentially you're delaying your tech debt until later, for a faster time to market now. Sometimes that's worth the trade off. Sometimes you need to go live now.
