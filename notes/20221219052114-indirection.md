# Indirection

>In [computer programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming "Computer programming"), **indirection** (also called dereferencing) is the ability to reference something using a name, reference, or container instead of the value itself

This is essentially everywhere. The primary example is pointers.

The difference between indirection and [[abstraction]] is pretty muddy. One take that makes the most sense to me is that abstraction is about **simplification**, and **indirection** is about location. In this sense, indirection is a special type of abstraction.
