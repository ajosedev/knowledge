# Lazy loading

[[20220911060950-code-splitting|Code splitting]] allows you to then take advantage of 'lazy loading'. When the user requires some code from your app, e.g. through a page route or button click, you can load the required code on-demand. The overall amount of code isn't reduced, but you've avoided loading code unnecessarily, as well as optimised the initial load.
