# NPM scripts adds to PATH

NPM scripts alter the environment to add extra information. Importantly, it adds `node_modules/.bin` to the `$PATH`, allowing you to run executable scripts from the `package.json`.

For example, the following will execute the `bar` script which exists in `node_modules/.bin`:
```json
{ 
  "name" : "foo", 
  "dependencies" : { 
    "bar" : "0.1.x" 
  }, 
  "scripts": { 
    "start" : "bar ./test" 
  } 
}
```

As always `npx` can be used to run npm packages.
