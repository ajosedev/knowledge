# Mixin pattern

>A mixin is an object that we can use in order to add reusable functionality to another object or class, without using inheritance. We can't use mixins on their own: their sole purpose is to add functionality to objects or classes without inheritance.

Rather than inheriting functionality, mixins allow you to add functionality through composition.

```js
class Dog {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}

const dogFunctionality = {
  bark: () => console.log("Woof!"),
  wagTail: () => console.log("Wagging my tail!"),
  play: () => console.log("Playing!")
};

Object.assign(Dog.prototype, dogFunctionality);
```
