# LVHA pseudo class order

Ordering pseudo classes on links should follow a specific order to make sure they apply at the correct time, as they do have overlap. This is commonly referred to as the LVHA order:

1. Link
2. Visited
3. Hover
4. Focus
5. Active

If focus is needed, it should follow the LVHFA order.
