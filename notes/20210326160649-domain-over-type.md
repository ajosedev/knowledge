# Group by domain, rather than type

When dealing with folder structure, library creation, file structure, etc. it's best to think about grouping by domain, rather than type. This helps avoid dumping grounds that become too bloated and no longer useful.

This is especially prevalent with folders such as `/components`, which groups every component together in a React project. A better abstraction would be to group by the domain or functionality, e.g. `layout`, `internationalisation`, etc.
