# SSR Module Federation

It's possible to use [[20210927141042-module-federation]] and [[20220912120502-server-side-rendering]] together, to get the best of both worlds. SSR MF means that we are sending the finished HTML to the browser, which is populated from all the remotes on the server.

Like with most SSR configurations, the implementation is quite complex and error-prone. When it comes to Module Federation, the current advice is to use NextJS with its supported SSR MF plugins.
