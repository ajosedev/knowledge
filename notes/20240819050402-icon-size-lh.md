# `lh` for sizing icons

`lh` is a great unit for sizing icons. Rather than sizing icons with `em` to get something close to the size of the font, sizing with `lh` gets the size of the line-height. This is often a more visually pleasing result.

Support is pretty good, but as of 2024 you may still want a fallback.
