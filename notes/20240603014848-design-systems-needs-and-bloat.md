# A desire is not a need

>It’s easy to see need for another component, another color, another xyz. Need is a strong word and usually confused with desirable. The more colors, type treatments, or whatever, you add to the system, the more complexity you own. More complexity means more maintenance, bugs, regressions, confusion, misinterpretation and general headaches. Be very careful what you commit to. It’s much easier to add things to a system than it is to remove them. Complexity is the rope you’ll hang yourself on.
>Discipline yourself to keep your system as small as possible. Focus on existing, real-world team needs and address them with the simplest solution. Yes, you won’t have everything people want. Yes, there will be gaps. And, yes, those gaps mean you may need to re-evaluate past decisions (more on that later).
>I’d argue a little thrash is far more healthy than a bloated system that can no longer get out of its own way.

I personally heavily agree with this. Before adding things to a design system, you should really question **why**. A lot of the time a need is not a need, it's just a want.
