# Background-clip in CSS

By default, a background extends to the `border-box` of the element. `background-clip` can be used to change this behaviour, i.e. to exclude padding:
```css
background-clip: content-box;
```

This also can be used in the `background` shorthand.

`text` can also be used as a value, but the support is a little worse.
