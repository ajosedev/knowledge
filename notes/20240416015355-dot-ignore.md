# .ignore files

Similar to `.gitignore`, the `.ignore` file is a psuedo-standard for [[shell]] tools like ripgrep or ag. Any paths present will be ignored by the search by default.

You can combo this with `.gitignore` to have a file that's ignored by git, but still searchable. Useful for some generated files.
