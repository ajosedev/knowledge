# Jumplist commands in Vim

### Jumps (:jumplist)

`CTRL+o` - cycle backwards through cursor positions
`CTRL+i` - cycle forwards through cursor positions

`''` - jump to position of last jump (start of line)
` `` ` - jump to position of last jump (same location on line)
\`\. - jump to position of last change

Note that `hjkl` don't update the jumplist, so commands like `''` will not work for `2j`

### Changes (:changes)

Each time you insert something in insert mode, the position of the cursor is saved in the change list.

`g;` - jump to position of the previous change
`g,` - jump to position of the next change
