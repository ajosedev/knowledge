# Cherry picking in Git

Because I always forget the syntax!

Cherry picking allows you to pick a commit and append it to the working HEAD.

`git cherry-pick <sha>` - cherry pick a single commit
`git cherry-pick A..D` - cherry pick a range of commits. This range does not include `A`!
`git cherry-pick A^..D` - cherry pick a range of commits, inclusive of `A`.
