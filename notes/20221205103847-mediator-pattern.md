# Mediator pattern

>The mediator pattern makes it possible for components to interact with each other through a central point: the mediator. Instead of directly talking to each other, the mediator receives the requests, and sends them forward! In JavaScript, the mediator is often nothing more than an object literal or a function.

Also known as the 'middleware pattern'.

Rather than having many-to-many communication methods between things, centralise it to a single location. Communication is much easier to parse and handle in a single spot.
