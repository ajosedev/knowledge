# Pit of success

> The Pit of Success: in stark contrast to a summit, a peak, or a journey across a desert to find victory through many trials and surprises, we want our customers to simply fall into winning practices by using our platform and frameworks. To the extent that (if) we make it easy to get into trouble, we fail.

This is very related to 'footguns', which should be avoided. A footgun is code written in a way where it makes it easy to do the wrong thing, or it makes unintended behaviour possible.

> a well-designed system makes it easy to do the right things and annoying (but not impossible) to do the wrong things

The pit of success and footguns and other terms are all related to the same thing: make it easy to do the right thing, and difficult to the wrong thing.
