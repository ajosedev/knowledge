# Server Driven UI (SDUI)

Airbnb has probably the most famous implementation of this with it's 'Ghost Platform'.

Rather than the backend handling data and each platform client handling the UI, SDUI tries to push some of the UI work towards the backend. This avoids problems with parity across different clients, and in the case of mobile apps, versioning required for updates.

The goal is for the client to be agnostic about what it's displaying. Rather than displaying a particular view, you receive information about the UI from the server, and display that. It includes how the page is laid out, the sections in the layout, the data in each section, and even CTAs.

In a way this is similar to a [[20221107050300-headless-cms|headless CMS]]. The data and authoring experience is split from the UI, and data can be transformed however wanted by the client.

The lines between the two are a little blurry. SDUI seems like a further extension of the idea. Rather than your client being responsible for rendering a 'blog post', SDUI may take it further and send agnostic sections and slices that end up creating a block post.
Rather than requesting data for a specific component and merging the two together on the client, the server informs you what components are rendered.

SDUI thus better fulfills the goal of parity across different clients.

The idea seems similar to what I did with 'Advanced Custom Fields' in Wordpress, or the `slices` side project https://github.com/ajosedev/slices. Both of these converted JSON data into a full page, with the JSON data including information about both the layout, components, and data involved in both of them.
