# font-size-adjust

>[Font size adjust](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-size-adjust) provides a simple way to conform all the fonts used in a string of text to be the same visual size — so every character in `1.4rem`-sized text, for example, has the same x-height — or cap height, `ch` width, `ic` width, or `ic` height. The two value syntax allows you to choose which measurement to conform.

This can be useful when you're mixing two fonts within a sentence, e.g. a monospace font for code and a regular font for copy.
