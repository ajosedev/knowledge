# Listing files with Typescript

>Print names of files that are part of the compilation and then stop processing.

Keep in mind this will follow the import tree - it's not just a list of files caught by the `includes` option.

```sh
tsc --listFilesOnly -p tsconfig.json
```

`--explainFiles` can also be useful.

>Print files read during the compilation including why it was included.
