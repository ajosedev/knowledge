# 12 Factor: 10. Dev/prod parity
**Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible**

There are gaps between development and production. Time, personnel, and tooling.

The twelve-factor app is designed for continuous deployment by keeping the gap between development and production small.

Backing services, such as the appâ€™s database, queueing system, or cache, is one area where dev/prod parity is important. Using a lightweight backing service in local and a more robust service in production is tempting, but should be avoided. Even when adapters theoretically abstract away the differences. These differences can manifest in strange ways, leading to 'production-only' errors that detract away from continuous deployment.

Adapters are still useful as they keep things [[20200307101703-easy-to-change]]. However all deploys should still be using the same type and version of the backing services.
