# CDK (Cloud Development Kit)

CDK is an [[20220627112853-infrastructure-as-code]] framework that provisions infrastructure through [[20220926121512-aws-cloudformation|CloudFormation]].
Rather than using a templating language (as done in CloudFormation), you get all the power of a programming language, such as Typescript. This has many benefits, including:
- Sharing high-level constructs
- Use programming idioms like conditionals, loops, etc
- Co-located infrastructure and application code
- Allows for easier code reviews, etc

Some key terminology:
**Resource** - An AWS resource CloudFormation uses, e.g. S3.
**Construct** - Building blocks of CDK apps. It represents a 'cloud component' and encapsulates everything CloudFormation needs to create the component. May contain one or more resources.
**Stack** - A unit of deployment. All resources defined within a stack are provisioned as a single unit.
**App** - A container for one or more stacks.
