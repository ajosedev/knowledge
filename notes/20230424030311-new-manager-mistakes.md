# "Some mistakes I made as a new manager"

https://www.benkuhn.net/newmgr

Managing doesn't have the same fast feedback loop as engineering. Hard to get dopamine or sense of achievement. Solution is to constantly ask for (specific) feedback, and look for other sources of fun and validation. Other sources could include your manager, or things outside of work. After a while you start to get better self-evaluation instincts.

It's risky to split your work between engineering and management. It often ends up in disappointing someone, especially if deadlines are present. If you want to stay on the tools, only pick up tasks that have no time pressure at all. Technical debt or extra polish is a good area to focus.

Don't micromanage, but also don't throw people into the deep end. Don't just tell a junior to write a [[20220926044417-rfcs-approval|RFC]] by themselves. They're often too scared to ask for help

Don't angst on hypotheticals when you can solve them by asking someone. Think you've annoyed someone? Just ask them. It gets you the answer much quicker, and puts you in a position to solve the problem if necessary.
