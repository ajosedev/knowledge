# Innersource

Using open source approaches and processes, but for proprietary software.

*From GitLab:*
Organizations that use InnerSource experience benefits that are typical of open source development, such as:

- **High-quality code**: With unit tests, code coverage, and continuous integration, teams improve code earlier in the lifecycle
- **Comprehensive documentation**: Code is better documented, both in comments and less formally in discussions, leading to a single source of truth
- **Effective code reuse**: Code and architecture are discoverable and available across teams and the organization
- **Strong collaboration**: Code reviews have [less friction](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2020/09/08/efficient-code-review-tips/), team communication becomes stronger, and contributions increase in number
- **Healthy culture**: Silos are [broken down](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/18/better-devops-with-gitlab-ci-cd/), so developer happiness improves, leading to better retainment and recruitment
