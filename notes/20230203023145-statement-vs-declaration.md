# Statements vs Declarations

The terms 'statement' and 'declaration' are often used interchangeably. However in [[js]], they have a precise formal meaning which relates to where it can be used in code.

Statements 'carry out actions'.
Declarations 'bind identifiers to values'.

Note that `import` (and `export`) are declarations, which means (technically) there's no such thing as an 'import statement'.

There are also expressions. Expressions produce a value. When it comes to [[react]], only expressions can be placed inside braces.
