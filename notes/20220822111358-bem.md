# BEM

> a CSS methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code sharing in frontâ€‘end development

Block, Element, Modifier. `.block__element--modifier`
Block - standalone entity meaningful on its own
Element - part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its blog
Modifier - a flag on a block or element

The main benefits are modularity and reusability. Helped solve issues where CSS would have a direct coupling on the DOM order, as you'd only be targeting a small amount of classes.  This meant the CSS was brittle, if the DOM changed, your nested selectors (e.g. `.class p > a`) would also break.

However there are issues around verbosity. Class names start to get increasingly long, and often need to be created even if there aren't associated styles.

A common solution to this is to use BEM selectors in SASS, however this drastically decreases readability, findability, debugging, and more. I personally don't recommend it as when you search for the class you won't find the CSS.
```css
.class {
	&--modifier {
	}
}
```
