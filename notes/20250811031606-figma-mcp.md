# Figma MCP

[[figma]] has a new Dev Mode [[20250811104331-mcp]] server. It's created to be a better way of providing design context to LLMs. Rather than just a static screenshot, it better extracts all of the information that's already present in Figma.

It helps take a bit of guesswork out of AI tools, assuming that you have good design-dev parity. If given a screenshot, an AI tool will have to search and guess what component is used from image recognition. Figma already has this information.
Additionally, it helps use better [[20250319091426-semantic-design-systems|sematics]], Figma already knows the difference between an 'error' red and a 'brand' red. A screenshot does not.

The MCP Server has three main tools to help with AI code generation: code, images, and variables.
- Code - by default it will generate React + Tailwind code, but this can be changed via the prompt. Additionally, using Code Connect will allow Figma to better pull from your design system code and generate using that.
- Images - images can be extracted and downloaded to files
- Variables - returns variables and styles used in your Figma selection. Similar to code, this can be bolstered by passing code snippets to your variable definitions.

Overall I see the value, but it does make me worried about [[20220902015338-vendoring|vendor lock in]]. To achieve best results, all of your information needs to be piped into Figma so it can be piped out. Things like Variables, Code Connect, etc. help with this. However it (currently) doesn't help the other parts of your design system. It doesn't pull from any standards, documentation, etc.

In an ideal world, I'd rather position Figma as just one part of a MCP Server, similar to what's described in https://www.designsystemscollective.com/figma-dev-mode-mcp-is-nice-but-we-need-design-system-mcps-bb599582da3d. A 'design system MCP'.
