# Coupling and Cohesion

One of the touted goals in Software is **Low Coupling, High Cohesion**.

**Coupling**
How much do elements know about the inner workings of another element?
How much do they depend on one another? Can they be broken apart?
The relationship **among** different modules, classes, components, etc.

We want to keep this low, so things are [[20200307101703-easy-to-change]].

**Cohesion**
How much the elements actually belong together. How strong is the relation?
Elements within a module should ideally do one particular thing. Related to the [[20221010033955-single-responsibility-principle]].
Refers to the elements **within** a module, class, component, etc.
