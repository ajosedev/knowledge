# Vitest vs Jest

Some #thoughts on the two.

Vitest feels a lot better. It definitely feels more modern, well supported, and I see why people are trending towards it generally.

Some benefits:
- Properly supports ESM out of the box, which is huge
- Integrates well with Vite, which is also gaining popularity

Anecdotally migrating from Jest to Vitest is also really easy. It uses very similar APIs, even for things like mocking.
