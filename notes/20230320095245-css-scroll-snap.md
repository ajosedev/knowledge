# CSS Scroll Snap

`scroll-snap-type`: This property is used on the scroll container to specify the type, direction, and optionality of scrolling.
`proximity` allows the browser to snap to content, but only when it is close by. `mandatory` requires the browser to snap, which can be considered more consistent.
	e.g. `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`

`scroll-snap-align`: This property is used on child elements to specify the scroll snap position.
	e.g. `scroll-snap-align: center`

`scroll-padding` is defined on the parent, and adds padding to each 'snap point'. When snapping, the scrolling will stop x pixels away from the section.
If you have a sticky header, this padding can be used to avoid overlapping the content. 

`scroll-margin` is defined on each child, and seems to effectively add a buffer room to each snap point.
