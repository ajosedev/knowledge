# Flex item minimum width

Similar to [[20200314212525-grid-blowouts]], it's possible to have flex items not shrink properly.

This most often occurs with long unbroken strings, or due to the nesting of your DOM. 

>To provide a more reasonable default minimum size for flex items, the used value of a main axis automatic minimum size on a flex item that is not a scroll container is a content-based minimum size; for scroll containers the automatic minimum size is zero, as usual.

Frustratingly, this can also happen when using [[20221219123110-intrinsic-sizes]], which seem to calculate differently.

There's two main solutions to this, both applied to the item that won't shrink enough - applying `min-width: 0`, or `overflow: hidden`.
