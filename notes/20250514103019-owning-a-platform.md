# Owning a platform vs a product

Platforms are more about expansion and foundational structure. As they are about supporting others, they often have a large breadth, supporting different use cases for everyone.
Importantly, everything you build has to be maintained. This adds cost, time, resources, etc. It's incredibly costly, and you can't really afford to knock things down and start again.

Products are often more about depth, or constant re-imagining and iteration. The total scope may not increase much, and as such there's less time spent in mainetance.
However there's more focus on refreshing things, or iterating on existing things. Think more vertical slices, where you can knock down a slice and start again.

It's in the realm of gardeners vs builders in general software engineering. Platform feels closer to a garden to me
