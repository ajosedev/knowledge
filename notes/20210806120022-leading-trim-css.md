# `leading-trim` in CSS (now `text-box`)

It's part of the _CSS Inline Layout Module Level 3_, and allows you to control the half-leading for better better visual alignment of text.

This is the native solution to what [Capsize](https://seek-oss.github.io/capsize/) aims to achieve. Text reserves space based on the font's cap height (or other heights), not just the line height.
Line heights can get particularly tricky when you need your component to be a certain height, but using a [[20240711115020-unitless-line-height]] gets you a decimal value, which may round  strangely.

As of 2025, this has started to be implemented as `text-box-trim` and `text-box-edge`. The former lets you choose if you trim the start/end, and the latter picks what you trim (e.g. cap, ex, etc).
