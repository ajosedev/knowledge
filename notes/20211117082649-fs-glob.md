# Globs in `fs`

`fs` doesn't have any support for globs/wildcards built-in. Instead, a package like `glob` can be used to work around this, which often provide a list of files for you to then use with `fs`.

```js
const { globSync } = require('glob')

const files = globSync('./src/**/*.scss);

files.forEach(file => {
	fs.readFile(file, (err, css) => {
		// ....
	})
})
```
