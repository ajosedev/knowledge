- Use `[[tags]]` over `#tags`
- Create topic pages rather than tags
- Use tags for status, rather than topics. e.g. `#topic-page`, `#new`
- Don't have to create pages for topics until they start to house a fair bit of content (shown in graph)
- Can then create a separate hierarchy of topic pages, e.g. interests -> programming -> javascript
- Topic pages can be fleshed out or just empty, they'll still be links on the graph even if a page doesn't exist

Use daily notes and later action them into proper notes

Use literature notes for podcasts, videos, articles, etc. and then later action them into proper notes.
Add the title, author, and url to help categorise them.
When done, move them to a separate 'archive' folder

Don't create a structure top-down, create the content and then create the structure for your content (bottom up)

- Review current topic pages, e.g. engineering, concepts, etc.
	- Is 'principles' good to introduce? How does this intersect with 'laws' or 'concepts', or even 'engineering'
		- I think principles is really 'design principles', so this would include laws too.
		- Concepts are for other random bits of knowledge, e.g. feature flags
		- Not sure what a 'pattern' is still
	- [[architecture]] seems like a good topic
- Flesh out current topic 
- Consider removing zettel prefix
	- Would be better for creating pages link-first
	- What does it add?
- Review if using `[[tags]]` is better than `#tags`
	- Might help if you have good topic pages?
- Introduce some new helper tags
	- #breakdown 
	- #todo?
	- #retag
